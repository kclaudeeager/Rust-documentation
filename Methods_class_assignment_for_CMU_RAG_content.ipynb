In the previous example, you\\ncould still access the Dateobject and change its value. The easy (and\\nunsafe)optionistoremembertherulesofnotmodifyingthestateofany\\nobject,butcopyingitwhennecessary.\\nAnother option is to wrap these classes. You could create an\\nImmutableDate class which wraps a Dateand doesn’t allow to modify\\nits state. It’s up to you to decide which solution you take. In this book\\nI won’t be very strict with immutability, so I won’t create wrappers for\\neverypotentiallydangerousclass.\\n9.3 Mapping an object into variables\\nThis process is known as declaration destructuring , and consists of mapping each\\nproperty inside an object into a variable. That’s the reason why the componentX\\nfunctionsareautomaticallycreated.Anexamplewiththeprevious Forecast class:\\n1val f1 = Forecast(Date(), 27.5f ,\"Shiny day\" )\\n2val (date, temperature, details) = f1\\nThismulti-declarationiscompileddowntothefollowingcode:'),\n",

Throughout this pages, we’ve learned Kotlin by\\nimplementinganAndroidAppasanexample.TheweatherAppwasagoodexample\\nto play with the basic features most Apps need: a master/detail UI, communication\\nwithanAPI,databasestorage,sharedpreferences…\\nThegoodthingaboutthismethodisthatyouhavelearnedthemostimportantKotlin\\nconcepts while using them. In my opinion, new knowledge is more easily absorbed\\nwhenitisputintoaction.Itwasmymaingoal,becausereferencebooksareusuallya\\nnicetooltosolvesomespecificdoubts,buttheyarehardtoreadfromthebeginning\\nto the very end. Besides, as the examples are usually out of a bigger context, it’s\\ndifficulttounderstandwhichkindofproblemsthosefeaturessolve.\\nAndthatwas,infact,theothergoalofthebook:toshowyourealproblemsweface\\ninAndroidandhowtheycanbesolvedusingKotlin.AnyAndroiddeveloperfindsa\\nlotofquestionswhendealingwithasynchrony,databases,orhastoimplementreally\\nverboselistenersoractivitynavigations.ByusingarealAppasanexample,wehave\\nansweredmanyofthesequestionswhilelearningnewlanguageorlibrariesfeatures.\\nI hope these goals were achieved, and I really wish that you not only learned\\nKotlinbutalsoenjoyedreadingthisbook.NowthatGooglehasadoptedKotlin,I’m\\nconvincedthatlearningthelanguageisreallythewaytogo:you’llenjoydeveloping\\nApps and be prepared for this new skill that will be soon a need in many Android\\njobpositions.\\nThis book is finished, but it doesn’t mean it’s dead. I’ll keep updating it to the\\nlatest versions of Kotlin, reviewing and improving it based on your comments and\\nsuggestions.Feelfreetowritemeaboutitatanymomentandtellmewhatyouthink,\\ntheerrorsyoufind,conceptsthatarenotclearenoughorwhateverconcernyoumay\\nhave.\\nIt’sbeenanamazingjourneyduringthemonthsI’vebeenwritingthisbook.Ihave\\nlearned a lot too, so thanks again for helping ‘Kotlin for Android Developers’ to\\nbecomeareality.'),\n",

Rust offers the option of control over low-level details (such as memory usage) in combination with high-level ergo-nomics, eliminating the hassle traditionally associated with low-level languages.\\nIn The Rust Programming Language, two members of \\nthe Rust Core Team will show you how to take full advantage of Rust’s features—from installation to creating your own robust and scalable programs. You’ll begin with the basics, like creating functions, choosing data types, and binding variables. Then you’ll move on to more advanced concepts, such as:\\n• Ownership and borrowing, lifetimes, and traits• Using Rust’s memory safety guarantees to build fast, \\nsafe programs\\n• Testing, error handling, and effective refactoring• Generics, smart pointers, multithreading, trait objects, \\nand advanced pattern matchingSHELVE IN: PROGRAMMING\\nLANGUAGES/RUST• Using Cargo, Rust’s built-in package manager, to \\nbuild, test, and document your code and manage \\ndependencies\\n• How best to use Rust’s advanced compiler with \\ncompiler-led programming techniques\\nYou’ll find plenty of code examples throughout the book as well as three chapters dedicated to building complete projects designed to test your learning: a number guessing game, a Rust implementation of a command line tool, and a multithreaded server.\\nABOUT THE AUTHORS\\nSteve Klabnik  leads the Rust documentation team and is \\none of Rust’s core developers.

              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 25}, page_content='xxiv   Introduction  Who Rust Is For\\nRust is ideal for many people for a variety of reasons. Let’s look at a few of \\nthe most important groups.\\nTeams of Developers\\nRust is proving to be a productive tool for collaboration among large teams of developers with varying levels of systems programming knowledge. Low-level code is prone to a variety of subtle bugs, which in most other languages can be caught only through extensive testing and careful code review by experi -\\nenced developers. In Rust, the compiler plays a gatekeeper role by refusing to compile code with these elusive bugs, including concurrency bugs. By work -\\ning alongside the compiler, the team can spend their time focusing on the program’s logic rather than chasing down bugs.\\nRust also brings contemporary developer tools to the systems pro -\\ngramming world:\\n•\\tCargo, the included dependency manager and build tool, makes adding, \\ncompiling, and managing dependencies painless and consistent across the Rust ecosystem.\\n•\\tRustfmt ensures a consistent coding style across developers.\\n•\\tThe Rust Language Server powers Integrated Development Environment (IDE) integration for code completion and inline error messages.\\nBy using these and other tools in the Rust ecosystem, developers can be \\nproductive while writing systems-level code.\\nStudents\\nRust is for students and those who are interested in learning about systems \\nconcepts. Using Rust, many people have learned about topics like operat -\\ning systems development. The community is very welcoming and happy to answer student questions. Through efforts such as this book, the Rust teams want to make systems concepts more accessible to more people, especially those new to programming.\\nCompanies\\nHundreds of companies, large and small, use Rust in production for a variety of tasks. Those tasks include command line tools, web services, DevOps tooling, embedded devices, audio and video analysis and transcoding, cryptocurrencies, bioinformatics, search engines, Internet of Things appli -\\ncations, machine learning, and even major parts of the Firefox web browser.\\nOpen Source Developers\\nRust is for people who want to build the Rust programming language, com -\\nmunity, developer tools, and libraries. We’d love to have you contribute to the Rust language.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='Introduction   xxvPeople Who Value Speed and Stability\\nRust is for people who crave speed and stability in a language. By speed, \\nwe mean the speed of the programs that you can create with Rust and the speed at which Rust lets you write them. The Rust compiler’s checks ensure stability through feature additions and refactoring. This is in contrast to the brittle legacy code in languages without these checks, which developers are often afraid to modify. By striving for zero-cost abstractions, higher-level features that compile to lower-level code as fast as code written manually, Rust endeavors to make safe code be fast code as well.\\nThe Rust language hopes to support many other users as well; those \\nmentioned here are merely some of the biggest stakeholders. Overall, Rust’s greatest ambition is to eliminate the trade-offs that programmers have accepted for decades by providing safety and  productivity, speed and  \\nergonomics. Give Rust a try and see if its choices work for you.\\nWho This Book Is For\\nThis book assumes that you’ve written code in another programming lan -\\nguage but doesn’t make any assumptions about which one. We’ve tried to make the material broadly accessible to those from a wide variety of pro -\\ngramming backgrounds. We don’t spend a lot of time talking about what programming is  or how to think about it. If you’re entirely new to program -\\nming, you would be better served by reading a book that specifically pro -\\nvides an introduction to programming.\\nHow to Use This Book\\nIn general, this book assumes that you’re reading it in sequence from front to back. Later chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters, and earlier chapters might not delve into details on a topic; we typically revisit the topic in a later chapter.\\nYou’ll find two kinds of chapters in this book: concept chapters and \\nproject chapters. In concept chapters, you’ll learn about an aspect of Rust. In project chapters, we’ll build small programs together, applying what you’ve learned so far. Chapters 2, 12, and 20 are project chapters; the rest are concept chapters.\\nChapter 1 explains how to install Rust, how to write a Hello, World! \\nprogram, and how to use Cargo, Rust’s package manager and build tool. Chapter 2 is a hands-on introduction to the Rust language. Here we cover concepts at a high level, and later chapters will provide additional detail. If you want to get your hands dirty right away, Chapter 2 is the place for that. At first, you might even want to skip Chapter 3, which covers Rust features similar to those of other programming languages, and head straight to Chapter 4 to learn about Rust’s ownership system. However, if you’re a partic -\\nularly meticulous learner who prefers to learn every detail before moving on \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content='xxvi   Introduction  to the next, you might want to skip Chapter 2 and go straight to Chapter  3, \\nreturning to Chapter 2 when you’d like to work on a project applying the \\ndetails you’ve learned. \\nChapter 5 discusses structs and methods, and Chapter 6 covers enums, \\nmatch  expressions, and the if let  control flow construct. You’ll use structs \\nand enums to make custom types in Rust.\\nIn Chapter 7, you’ll learn about Rust’s module system and about privacy \\nrules for organizing your code and its public Application Programming Interface (API). Chapter 8 discusses some common collection data struc -\\ntures that the standard library provides, such as vectors, strings, and hash maps. Chapter 9 explores Rust’s error-handling philosophy and techniques.\\nChapter 10 digs into generics, traits, and lifetimes, which give you the \\npower to define code that applies to multiple types. Chapter 11 is all about testing, which even with Rust’s safety guarantees is necessary to ensure your program’s logic is correct. In Chapter 12, we’ll build our own imple -\\nmentation of a subset of functionality from the \\ngrep command line tool \\nthat searches for text within files. For this, we’ll use many of the concepts we discussed in the previous chapters.\\nChapter 13 explores closures and iterators: features of Rust that come \\nfrom functional programming languages. In Chapter 14, we’ll examine Cargo in more depth and talk about best practices for sharing your libraries with others. Chapter 15 discusses smart pointers that the standard library provides and the traits that enable their functionality.\\nIn Chapter 16, we’ll walk through different models of concurrent \\nprogramming and talk about how Rust helps you to program in multiple threads fearlessly. Chapter 17 looks at how Rust idioms compare to object-oriented programming principles you might be familiar with.\\nChapter 18 is a reference on patterns and pattern matching, which are \\npowerful ways of expressing ideas throughout Rust programs. Chapter 19 contains a smorgasbord of advanced topics of interest, including unsafe Rust and more about lifetimes, traits, types, functions, and closures.\\nIn Chapter 20, we’ll complete a project in which we’ll implement a low-\\nlevel multithreaded web server!\\nFinally, some appendixes contain useful information about the lan -\\nguage in a more reference-like format. Appendix A covers Rust’s keywords, Appendix B covers Rust’s operators and symbols, Appendix C covers deriv -\\nable traits provided by the standard library, and Appendix D covers macros.\\nThere is no wrong way to read this book: if you want to skip ahead, go \\nfor it! You might have to jump back to earlier chapters if you experience any confusion. But do whatever works for you.\\nAn important part of the process of learning Rust is learning how to \\nread the error messages the compiler displays: these will guide you toward working code. As such, we’ll provide many examples of code that doesn’t compile along with the error message the compiler will show you in each situation. Know that if you enter and run a random example, it may not com -\\npile! Make sure you read the surrounding text to see whether the example you’re trying to run is meant to error. In most situations, we’ll lead you to the correct version of any code that doesn’t compile.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

It’s trad -\\nitional when learning a new language to write a little program that prints the text \\nHello, world!  to the screen, so we’ll do the same here!\\nnote  This book assumes basic familiarity with the command line. Rust makes no specific demands about your editing or tooling or where your code lives, so if you prefer to use an integrated development environment (IDE) instead of the command line, feel free to use your favorite IDE. Many IDEs now have some degree of Rust support; check the IDE’s documentation for details. Recently, the Rust team has been focusing on enabling great IDE support, and progress has been made rapidly on that front!\\nCreating a Project Directory\\nYou’ll start by making a directory to store your Rust code. It doesn’t matter to Rust where your code lives, but for the exercises and projects in this book, we suggest making a projects  directory in your home directory and keeping all \\nyour projects there.\\nOpen a terminal and enter the following commands to make a projects  \\ndirectory and a directory for the Hello, world! project within the projects  \\ndirectory.\\nFor Linux and macOS, enter this:\\n$ mkdir ~/projects\\n$ cd ~/projects\\n$ mkdir hello_world\\n$ cd hello_world\\nFor Windows CMD, enter this:\\n> mkdir \"%USERPROFILE%\\\\projects\"> cd /d \"%USERPROFILE%\\\\projects\"\\n> mkdir hello_world\\n> cd hello_world\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Rust files always end with \\nthe .rs  extension. If you’re using more than one word in your filename, use \\nan underscore to separate them. For example, use hello_world.rs  rather than \\nhelloworld.rs .\\nNow open the main.rs  file you just created and enter the code in Listing 1-1.\\nfn main() {    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\\n}\\nListing 1-1: A program that prints \\nHello, world!\\nSave the file and go back to your terminal window.

That makes you a Rust programmer—welcome!\\nAnatomy of a Rust Program\\nLet’s review in detail what just happened in your Hello, world! program. Here’s the first piece of the puzzle:\\nfn main() {\\n}\\nThese lines define a function in Rust. The main function is special: it is \\nalways the first code that runs in every executable Rust program. The first main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

If there were parameters, they would go inside the parentheses, ().\\nAlso, note that the function body is wrapped in curly brackets, {}. Rust \\nrequires these around all function bodies. It’s good style to place the open -\\ning curly bracket on the same line as the function declaration, adding one \\nspace in between.\\nAt the time of this writing, an automatic formatter tool called rustfmt  \\nis under development. If you want to stick to a standard style across Rust projects, \\nrustfmt  will format your code in a particular style. The Rust team \\nplans to eventually include this tool with the standard Rust distribution, like \\nrustc . So depending on when you read this book, it might already be \\ninstalled on your computer! Check the online documentation for more details.\\nInside the \\nmain function is the following code:\\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\\nThis line does all the work in this little program: it prints text to the \\nscreen. There are four important details to notice here. First, Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.\\nSecond, \\nprintln!  calls a Rust macro. If it called a function instead, it \\nwould be entered as println  (without the  !). We’ll discuss Rust macros in \\nmore detail in Appendix D. For now, you just need to know that using a ! \\nmeans that you’re calling a macro instead of a normal function.\\nThird, you see the \"Hello, world!\"  string. We pass this string as an argu -\\nment to println! , and the string is printed to the screen.\\nFourth, we end the line with a semicolon ( ;), which indicates that this \\nexpression is over and the next one is ready to begin. Most lines of Rust code end with a semicolon.\\nCompiling and Running Are Separate Steps\\nYou’ve just run a newly created program, so let’s examine each step in the process.\\nBefore running a Rust program, you must compile it using the Rust \\ncompiler by entering the \\nrustc  command and passing it the name of your \\nsource file, like this:\\n$ rustc main.rs\\nIf you have a C or C++ background, you’ll notice that this is similar to \\ngcc or clang . After compiling successfully, Rust outputs a binary executable.\\nOn Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, you can see the execut -\\nable by entering the ls command in your shell as follows:\\n$ ls\\nmain  main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

From \\nhere, you run the main or main.exe  file, like this:\\n$ ./main  # or .\\\\main.exe on Windows\\nIf main.rs  was your Hello, world! program, this line would print Hello, \\nworld!  to your terminal.\\nIf you’re more familiar with a dynamic language, such as Ruby, Python, \\nor JavaScript, you might not be used to compiling and running a program \\nas separate steps. Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled  language, meaning you can \\ncompile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed. If you give someone a .rb , .py, or .js  \\nfile, they need to have a Ruby, Python, or JavaScript implementation installed (respectively). But in those languages, you need only one command to com -\\npile and run your program. Everything is a trade-off in language design.\\nJust compiling with \\nrustc  is fine for simple programs, but as your project \\ngrows, you’ll want to manage all the options and make it easy to share your code. Next, we’ll introduce you to the Cargo tool, which will help you write real-world Rust programs.\\nHello, Cargo!\\nCargo is Rust’s build system and package manager. Most Rustaceans use this tool to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you, such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries. (We call libraries your code needs dependencies .)\\nThe simplest Rust programs, like the one we’ve written so far, don’t have \\nany dependencies. So if we had built the Hello, world! project with Cargo, it would only use the part of Cargo that handles building your code. As you write more complex Rust programs, you’ll add dependencies, and if you start a project using Cargo, adding dependencies will be much easier to do.\\nBecause the vast majority of Rust projects use Cargo, the rest of \\nthis book assumes that you’re using Cargo, too. Cargo comes installed with Rust if you used the official installers discussed in “Installation” on page 1. If you installed Rust through some other means, check whether Cargo is installed by entering the following into your terminal:\\n$ cargo --version\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='8   Chapter 1If you see a version number, you have it! If you see an error, such as \\ncommand not found , look at the documentation for your method of installa -\\ntion to determine how to install Cargo separately.\\nCreating a Project with Cargo\\nLet’s create a new project using Cargo and look at how it differs from our \\noriginal Hello, world! project. Navigate back to your projects  directory (or \\nwherever you decided to store your code). Then, on any operating system, run the following:\\n$ cargo new hello_cargo --bin\\n$ cd hello_cargo\\nThe first command creates a new binary executable called hello_cargo . \\nThe --bin  argument passed to cargo new  makes an executable application \\n(often just called a binary ) as opposed to a library. We’ve named our project \\nhello_cargo , and Cargo creates its files in a directory of the same name.\\nGo into the hello_cargo  directory and list the files. You’ll see that Cargo \\nhas generated two files and one directory for us: a Cargo.toml  file and a src  \\ndirectory with a main.rs  file inside. It has also initialized a new Git repository \\nalong with a .gitignore file.\\nnote  Git is a common version control system. You can change cargo new  to use a different \\nversion control system or no version control system by using the --vcs  flag. Run cargo \\nnew --help  to see the available options.\\nOpen Cargo.toml  in your text editor of choice. It should look similar to \\nthe code in Listing 1-2.\\n[package]name = \"hello_cargo\"\\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\\nauthors = [\"Your Name <you@example.com>\"]\\n[dependencies]\\nListing 1-2: Contents of Cargo.toml  generated by \\ncargo new\\nThis file is in the TOML  (Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language ) format, \\nwhich is Cargo’s configuration format.\\nThe first line, [package] , is a section heading that indicates that the fol -\\nlowing statements are configuring a package. As we add more information \\nto this file, we’ll add other sections.\\nThe next three lines set the configuration information Cargo needs to \\ncompile your program: the name, the version, and who wrote it. Cargo gets your name and email information from your environment, so if that infor -\\nmation is not correct, fix the information now and then save the file.Cargo.toml\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='Getting Started    9The last line, [dependencies] , is the start of a section for you to list any \\nof your project’s dependencies. In Rust, packages of code are referred to as \\ncrates . We won’t need any other crates for this project, but we will in the first \\nproject in Chapter 2, so we’ll use this dependencies section then.\\nNow open src/main.rs  and take a look:\\nfn main() {\\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\\n}\\nCargo has generated a Hello, world! program for you, just like the one \\nwe wrote in Listing 1-1! So far, the differences between our previous project \\nand the project Cargo generates are that Cargo placed the code in the src  \\ndirectory and we have a Cargo.toml  configuration file in the top directory.\\nCargo expects your source files to live inside the src  directory. The top-\\nlevel project directory is just for README files, license information, config -\\nuration files, and anything else not related to your code. Using Cargo helps you organize your projects. There’s a place for everything, and everything is in its place.\\nIf you started a project that doesn’t use Cargo, as we did with the \\nHello, world! project, you can convert it to a project that does use Cargo. Move the project code into the src  directory and create an appropriate \\nCargo.toml  file.\\nBuilding and Running a Cargo Project\\nNow let’s look at what’s different when we build and run the Hello, world! program with Cargo! From your hello_cargo  directory, build your project by \\nentering the following command:\\n$ cargo build\\n   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)\\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.85 secs\\nThis command creates an executable file in target/debug/hello_cargo  (or \\ntarget\\\\debug\\\\hello_cargo.exe  on Windows) rather than in your current direc -\\ntory. You can run the executable with this command:\\n$ ./target/debug/hello_cargo # or .\\\\target\\\\debug\\\\hello_cargo.exe on Windows\\nHello, world!\\nIf all goes well, Hello, world!  should print to the terminal. Running \\ncargo build  for the first time also causes Cargo to create a new file at the top \\nlevel: Cargo.lock . This file keeps track of the exact versions of dependencies \\nin your project. This project doesn’t have dependencies, so the file is a bit \\nsparse. You won’t ever need to change this file manually; Cargo manages its contents for you.src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 39}, page_content='10   Chapter 1We just built a project with cargo build  and ran it with ./target/debug/\\nhello_cargo , but we can also use cargo run  to compile the code and then run \\nthe resulting executable all in one command:\\n$ cargo run\\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs\\n     Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`\\nHello, world!\\nNotice that this time we didn’t see output indicating that Cargo was \\ncompiling hello_cargo . Cargo figured out that the files hadn’t changed, so it \\njust ran the binary. If you had modified your source code, Cargo would have \\nrebuilt the project before running it, and you would have seen this output:\\n$ cargo run\\n   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)\\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.33 secs\\n     Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`\\nHello, world!\\nCargo also provides a command called cargo check . This command \\nquickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesn’t produce \\nan executable:\\n$ cargo check\\n   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)\\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32 secs\\nWhy would you not want an executable? Often, cargo check  is much \\nfaster than cargo build , because it skips the step of producing an executable. \\nIf you’re continually checking your work while writing the code, using cargo \\ncheck  will speed up the process! As such, many Rustaceans run cargo check  \\nperiodically as they write their program to make sure it compiles. Then \\nthey run cargo build  when they’re ready to use the executable.\\nLet’s recap what we’ve learned so far about Cargo:\\n•\\tWe can build a project using cargo build  or cargo check .\\n•\\tWe can build and run a project in one step using cargo run .\\n•\\tInstead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug  directory.\\nAn additional advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the \\nsame no matter which operating system you’re working on. So, at this point, we’ll no longer provide specific instructions for Linux and macOS versus Windows.\\nBuilding for Release\\nWhen your project is finally ready for release, you can use cargo build \\n--release  to compile it with optimizations. This command will create an \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 40}, page_content='Getting Started    11executable in target/release  instead of target/debug . The optimizations make \\nyour Rust code run faster, but turning them on lengthens the time it takes \\nfor your program to compile. This is why there are two different profiles: one for development, when you want to rebuild quickly and often, and another for building the final program you’ll give to a user that won’t be rebuilt repeatedly and that will run as fast as possible. If you’re bench -\\nmarking your code’s running time, be sure to run \\ncargo build --release  \\nand benchmark with the executable in target/release .\\nCargo as Convention\\nWith simple projects, Cargo doesn’t provide a lot of value over just using \\nrustc , but it will prove its worth as your programs become more intricate. \\nWith complex projects composed of multiple crates, it’s much easier to let Cargo coordinate the build.\\nEven though the \\nhello_cargo  project is simple, it now uses much of the \\nreal tooling you’ll use in the rest of your Rust career. In fact, to work on any existing projects, you can use the following commands to check out the code using Git, change to that project’s directory, and build:\\n$ git clone someurl.com/someproject\\n$ cd someproject\\n$ cargo build\\nFor more information about Cargo, check out its documentation at \\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/ .\\nSummary\\nYou’re already off to a great start on your Rust journey! In this chapter, \\nyou’ve learned how to:\\n•\\tInstall the latest stable version of Rust using rustup\\n•\\tUpdate to a newer Rust version\\n•\\tOpen locally installed documentation\\n•\\tWrite and run a Hello, world! program using rustc  directly \\n•\\tCreate and run a new project using the conventions of CargoThis is a great time to build a more substantial program to get used \\nto reading and writing Rust code.

For now, all you need to know is that like variables, references are immu -\\ntable by default. Hence, you need to write \\n&mut guess  rather than &guess  to \\nmake it mutable. (Chapter 4 will explain references more thoroughly.)\\nHandling Potential Failure with the Result Type\\nWe’re not quite done with this line of code. Although what we’ve discussed so far is a single line of text, it’s only the first part of the single logical line of code. The second part is this method:\\n.expect(\"Failed to read line\");\\nWhen you call a method with the .foo()  syntax, it’s often wise to intro -\\nduce a newline and other whitespace to help break up long lines. We could have written this code as:\\nio::stdin().read_line(&mut guess).expect(\"Failed to read line\");\\nHowever, one long line is difficult to read, so it’s best to divide it: two \\nlines for two method calls. Now let’s discuss what this line does.\\nAs mentioned earlier, read_line  puts what the user types into the string \\nwe’re passing it, but it also returns a value—in this case, an io::Result . Rust \\nhas a number of types named Result  in its standard library: a generic Result  \\nas well as specific versions for submodules, such as io::Result .\\nThe Result  types are enumerations , often referred to as enums . An \\nenumeration is a type that can have a fixed set of values, and those values are called the enum’s variants . Chapter 6 will cover enums in more detail. \\nFor \\nResult , the variants are Ok or Err. The Ok variant indicates the opera -\\ntion was successful, and inside Ok is the successfully generated value. The \\nErr variant means the operation failed, and Err contains information about \\nhow or why the operation failed. \\nThe purpose of these Result  types is to encode error-handling informa -\\ntion. Values of the Result  type, like values of any type, have methods defined \\non them. An instance of io::Result  has an expect  method that you can call. \\nIf this instance of io::Result  is an Err value, expect  will cause the program to \\ncrash and display the message that you passed as an argument to expect . If \\nthe read_line  method returns an Err, it would likely be the result of an error \\ncoming from the underlying operating system. If this instance of io::Result  \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 47}, page_content='18   Chapter 2is an Ok value, expect  will take the return value that Ok is holding and return \\njust that value to you so you can use it. In this case, that value is the number \\nof bytes in what the user entered into standard input.\\nIf you don’t call expect , the program will compile, but you’ll get a warning:\\n$ cargo build\\n   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)\\nwarning: unused `std::result::Result` which must be used\\n  --> src/main.rs:10:5\\n   |\\n10 |     io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess);   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n   |\\n   = note: #[warn(unused_must_use)] on by default\\nRust warns that you haven’t used the Result  value returned from \\nread_line , indicating that the program hasn’t handled a possible error. \\nThe right way to suppress the warning is to actually write error handling, \\nbut because you just want to crash this program when a problem occurs, you \\ncan use expect . You’ll learn about recovering from errors in Chapter 9.\\nPrinting Values with println! Placeholders\\nAside from the closing curly brackets, there’s only one more line to discuss in the code added so far, which is the following:\\nprintln!(\"You guessed: {}\", guess);\\nThis line prints the string we saved the user’s input in. The set of curly \\nbrackets, {}, is a placeholder: think of {} as little crab pincers that hold a \\nvalue in place. You can print more than one value using curly brackets: the first set of curly brackets holds the first value listed after the format string, the second set holds the second value, and so on. Printing multiple values in one call to \\nprintln!  would look like this:\\nlet x = 5;\\nlet y = 10;\\nprintln!(\"x = {} and y = {}\", x, y);\\nThis code would print x = 5 and y = 10 .\\nTesting the First Part\\nLet’s test the first part of the guessing game.

Let’s use a random number between 1 and 100 so the game isn’t too difficult. Rust doesn’t yet include random number func -\\ntionality in its standard library. However, the Rust team does provide a \\nrand \\ncrate at https://crates.io/crates/rand/ .\\nUsing a Crate to Get More Functionality\\nRemember that a crate is a package of Rust code. The project we’ve been building is a binary crate , which is an executable. The \\nrand crate is a library \\ncrate, which contains code intended to be used in other programs.\\nCargo’s use of external crates is where it really shines. Before we can \\nwrite code that uses rand, we need to modify the Cargo.toml  file to include \\nthe rand crate as a dependency. Open that file now and add the following \\nline to the bottom beneath the [dependencies]  section header that Cargo \\ncreated for you:\\n[dependencies]\\nrand = \"0.3.14\"\\nIn the Cargo.toml  file, everything that follows a header is part of a section \\nthat continues until another section starts. The [dependencies]  section is where \\nyou tell Cargo which external crates your project depends on and which ver -\\nsions of those crates you require. In this case, we’ll specify the rand crate with \\nthe semantic version specifier 0.3.14 . Cargo understands Semantic Versioning \\n(sometimes called SemVer ), which is a standard for writing version numbers. \\nThe number 0.3.14  is actually shorthand for ^0.3.14 , which means “any ver -\\nsion that has a public API compatible with version 0.3.14.”\\nNow, without changing any of the code, let’s build the project, as shown \\nin Listing 2-2.\\n$ cargo build\\n    Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`\\n Downloading rand v0.3.14\\n Downloading libc v0.2.14\\n   Compiling libc v0.2.14\\n   Compiling rand v0.3.14Cargo.toml\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Crates.io is where people in the Rust ecosystem post their open \\nsource Rust projects for others to use.\\nAfter updating the registry, Cargo checks the [dependencies]  section \\nand downloads any crates you don’t have yet. In this case, although we only \\nlisted rand as a dependency, Cargo also grabbed a copy of libc, because rand \\ndepends on libc to work. After downloading the crates, Rust compiles them \\nand then compiles the project with the dependencies available.\\nIf you immediately run cargo build  again without making any changes, \\nyou won’t get any output aside from the Finished  line. Cargo knows it has \\nalready downloaded and compiled the dependencies, and you haven’t changed anything about them in your Cargo.toml  file. Cargo also knows that \\nyou haven’t changed anything about your code, so it doesn’t recompile that either. With nothing to do, it simply exits. \\nIf you open the src/main.rs  file, make a trivial change, and then save it \\nand build again, you’ll only see two lines of output:\\n$ cargo build\\n   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)\\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.50 secs\\nThese lines show Cargo only updates the build with your tiny change \\nto the src/main.rs  file. Your dependencies haven’t changed, so Cargo knows \\nit can reuse what it has already downloaded and compiled for those. It just \\nrebuilds your part of the code.\\nEnsuring Reproducible Builds with the Cargo.lock File\\nCargo has a mechanism that ensures you can rebuild the same artifact \\nevery time you or anyone else builds your code: Cargo will use only the ver -\\nsions of the dependencies you specified until you indicate otherwise. For example, what happens if next week version 0.3.15 of the \\nrand crate comes \\nout and contains an important bug fix but also contains a regression that will break your code?\\nThe answer to this problem is the Cargo.lock  file, which was created the \\nfirst time you ran \\ncargo build  and is now in your guessing_game  directory. \\nWhen you build a project for the first time, Cargo figures out all the ver -\\nsions of the dependencies that fit the criteria and then writes them to the Cargo.lock  file. When you build your project in the future, Cargo will see \\nthat the Cargo.lock\\n file exists and use the versions specified there rather \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

This lets you have a \\nreproducible build automatically. In other words, your project will remain at 0.3.14 until you explicitly upgrade, thanks to the Cargo.lock  file.\\nUpdating a Crate to Get a New Version\\nWhen you do  want to update a crate, Cargo provides another command, \\nupdate , which will ignore the Cargo.lock  file and figure out all the latest ver -\\nsions that fit your specifications in Cargo.toml . If that works, Cargo will write \\nthose versions to the Cargo.lock  file.\\nBut by default, Cargo will only look for versions larger than 0.3.0 and \\nsmaller than 0.4.0. If the rand crate has released two new versions, 0.3.15 \\nand 0.4.0, you would see the following if you ran cargo update :\\n$ cargo update\\n    Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`\\n    Updating rand v0.3.14 -> v0.3.15\\nAt this point, you would also notice a change in your Cargo.lock  file noting \\nthat the version of the rand crate you are now using is 0.3.15.\\nIf you wanted to use rand version 0.4.0 or any version in the 0.4. x series, \\nyou’d have to update the Cargo.toml  file to look like this instead:\\n[dependencies]\\nrand = \"0.4.0\"\\nThe next time you run cargo build , Cargo will update the registry of \\ncrates available and reevaluate your rand requirements according to the \\nnew version you have specified.\\nThere’s a lot more to say about Cargo and its ecosystem which we’ll dis -\\ncuss in Chapter 14, but for now, that’s all you need to know. Cargo makes it \\nvery easy to reuse libraries, so Rustaceans are able to write smaller projects that are assembled from a number of packages.\\nGenerating a Random Number\\nNow that you’ve added the rand crate to Cargo.toml , let’s start using rand. The \\nnext step is to update src/main.rs , as shown in Listing 2-3.\\nu extern crate rand;\\nuse std::io;\\nv use rand::Rng;\\nfn main() {\\n    println!(\"Guess the number!\");\\n    w let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101);\\n    println!(\"The secret number is: {}\", secret_number);Cargo.toml\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

This also does the equivalent of calling use rand , \\nso now we can call anything in the rand crate by placing rand::  before it.\\nNext, we add another use line: use rand::Rng  v. The Rng trait defines \\nmethods that random number generators implement, and this trait must be \\nin scope for us to use those methods. Chapter 10 will cover traits in detail.\\nAlso, we’re adding two more lines in the middle w . The rand::thread_rng  \\nfunction will give us the particular random number generator that we’re going to use: one that is local to the current thread of execution and seeded by the operating system. Next, we call the \\ngen_range  method on the random \\nnumber generator. This method is defined by the Rng trait that we brought \\ninto scope with the use rand::Rng statement. The gen_range  method takes two \\nnumbers as arguments and generates a random number between them. It’s inclusive on the lower bound but exclusive on the upper bound, so we need to specify \\n1 and 101 to request a number between 1 and 100.\\nnote  You won’t just know which traits to use and which functions and methods to call from a crate. Instructions for using a crate are in each crate’s documentation. Another neat feature of Cargo is that you can run the \\ncargo doc --open  command, \\nwhich will build documentation provided by all of your dependencies locally and open it in your browser. If you’re interested in other functionality in the \\nrand crate, \\nfor example, run cargo doc --open and click rand  in the sidebar on the left.\\nThe second line that we added to the code prints the secret number. \\nThis is useful while we’re developing the program to be able to test it, but we’ll delete it from the final version. It’s not much of a game if the program prints the answer as soon as it starts!\\nTry running the program a few times:\\n$ cargo run \\n   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)\\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.50 secs     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`\\nGuess the number!The secret number is: 7\\nPlease input your guess.\\n4\\nYou guessed: 4\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Like Result , Ordering  \\nis another enum, but the variants for Ordering  are Less, Greater , and Equal . \\nThese are the three outcomes that are possible when you compare two \\nvalues.\\nThen we add five new lines at the bottom that use the Ordering  type. The \\ncmp method w  compares two values and can be called on anything that can \\nbe compared. It takes a reference to whatever you want to compare with: here it’s comparing the \\nguess  to the secret_number . Then it returns a variant of the \\nOrdering  enum we brought into scope with the use statement. We use a match  \\nexpression v to decide what to do next based on which variant of Ordering  \\nwas returned from the call to cmp with the values in guess  and secret_number .src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 53}, page_content='24   Chapter 2A match  expression is made up of arms . An arm consists of a pattern  \\nand the code that should be run if the value given to the beginning of the \\nmatch expression fits that arm’s pattern. Rust takes the value given to match  \\nand looks through each arm’s pattern in turn. The match  construct and \\npatterns are powerful features in Rust that let you express a variety of situ -\\nations your code might encounter and make sure that you handle them \\nall. These features will be covered in detail in Chapter 6 and Chapter 18, respectively.\\nLet’s walk through an example of what would happen with the \\nmatch  \\nexpression used here. Say that the user has guessed 50 and the randomly generated secret number this time is 38. When the code compares 50 to 38, the \\ncmp method will return Ordering::Greater , because 50 is greater than 38. \\nThe match  expression gets the Ordering::Greater  value and starts checking \\neach arm’s pattern. It looks at the first arm’s pattern, Ordering::Less , and sees \\nthat the value Ordering::Greater  does not match Ordering::Less , so it ignores \\nthe code in that arm and moves to the next arm. The next arm’s pattern, \\nOrdering::Greater , does  match Ordering::Greater ! The associated code in that \\narm will execute and print Too big!  to the screen. The match  expression ends \\nbecause it has no need to look at the last arm in this scenario.\\nHowever, the code in Listing 2-4 won’t compile yet. Let’s try it:\\n$ cargo build\\n   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)\\nerror[E0308]: mismatched types\\n  --> src/main.rs:23:21\\n   |\\n23 |     match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {   |                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected struct `std::string::String`, \\nfound integral variable\\n   |\\n   = note: expected type `&std::string::String`\\n   = note:    found type `&{integer}`\\nerror: aborting due to previous error\\nCould not compile `guessing_game`.\\nThe core of the error states that there are mismatched types . Rust has a \\nstrong, static type system. However, it also has type inference. When we wrote \\nlet guess = String::new() , Rust was able to infer that guess  should be a String  \\nand didn’t make us write the type. The secret_number , on the other hand, is a \\nnumber type. A few number types can have a value between 1 and 100: i32, a \\n32-bit number; u32, an unsigned 32-bit number; i64, a 64-bit number; as well \\nas others. Rust defaults to an i32, which is the type of secret_number  unless you \\nadd type information elsewhere that would cause Rust to infer a different \\nnumerical type.

We \\ncan do that by adding the following two lines to the main function body:\\n// --snip--\\n    let mut guess = String::new();    io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)\\n        .expect(\"Failed to read line\");\\n    let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse()\\n        .expect(\"Please type a number!\");\\n    println!(\"You guessed: {}\", guess);\\n    match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {\\n        Ordering::Less => println!(\"Too small!\"),\\n        Ordering::Greater => println!(\"Too big!\"),\\n        Ordering::Equal => println!(\"You win!\"),\\n    }}\\nWe create a variable named guess . But wait, doesn’t the program \\nalready have a variable named guess ? It does, but Rust allows us to shadow  \\nthe previous value of guess  with a new one. This feature is often used in \\nsituations in which you want to convert a value from one type to another \\ntype. Shadowing lets us reuse the guess  variable name rather than forcing \\nus to create two unique variables, such as guess_str  and guess , for example. \\n(Chapter 3 covers shadowing in more detail.) \\nWe bind guess  to the expression guess.trim().parse() . The guess  in the \\nexpression refers to the original guess  that was a String  with the input in it. \\nThe trim method on a String  instance will eliminate any whitespace at the \\nbeginning and end. Although u32 can contain only numerical characters, \\nthe user must press enter  to satisfy read_line . When the user presses enter , \\na newline character is added to the string. For example, if the user types 5 \\nand presses enter , guess  looks like this: 5\\\\n. The \\\\n represents “newline,” the \\nresult of pressing enter . The trim method eliminates \\\\n, resulting in just 5.\\nThe parse  method on strings parses a string into some kind of number. \\nBecause this method can parse a variety of number types, we need to tell Rust the exact number type we want by using \\nlet guess: u32 . The colon ( :) \\nafter guess  tells Rust we’ll annotate the variable’s type. Rust has a few built- \\nin number types; the u32 seen here is an unsigned, 32-bit integer. It’s a good \\ndefault choice for a small positive number. You’ll learn about other number types in Chapter 3. Additionally, the \\nu32 annotation in this example pro -\\ngram and the comparison with secret_number mean that Rust will infer that \\nsecret_number should be a u32 type as well. So now the comparison will be \\nbetween two values of the same type! src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

We’ll treat this Result  the same way by using the expect  \\nmethod again. If parse  returns an Err Result  variant because it couldn’t cre -\\nate a number from the string, the expect  call will crash the game and print \\nthe message we give it.

We can do that by altering the line where \\nguess  is converted from a String  to a u32, as shown in Listing 2-5.\\n// --snip--\\nio::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)\\n    .expect(\"Failed to read line\");\\nlet guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {\\n    Ok(num) => num,\\n    Err(_) => continue,\\n};\\nprintln!(\"You guessed: {}\", guess);// --snip--\\nListing 2-5: Ignoring a non-number guess and asking for another guess instead of crash -\\ning the program\\nSwitching from an expect  call to a match  expression is how you generally \\nmove from crashing on an error to handling the error. Remember that parse  \\nreturns a Result  type and Result  is an enum that has the variants Ok or Err. \\nWe’re using a match  expression here, as we did with the Ordering  result of the \\ncmp method.\\nIf parse  is able to successfully turn the string into a number, it will \\nreturn an Ok value that contains the resulting number. That Ok value will \\nmatch the first arm’s pattern, and the match  expression will just return the \\nnum value that parse  produced and put inside the Ok value. That number will \\nend up right where we want it in the new guess  variable we’re creating.\\nIf parse  is not  able to turn the string into a number, it will return an Err \\nvalue that contains more information about the error. The Err value does \\nnot match the Ok(num)  pattern in the first match  arm, but it does match the \\nErr(_)  pattern in the second arm. The underscore, _, is a catchall value; in \\nthis example, we’re saying we want to match all Err values, no matter what \\ninformation they have inside them. So the program will execute the second src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 61}, page_content='32   Chapter 3Keywords\\nThe Rust language has a set of keywords  that are reserved for use by the lan -\\nguage only, much as in other languages. Keep in mind that you cannot use \\nthese words as names of variables or functions. Most of the keywords have \\nspecial meanings, and you’ll be using them to do various tasks in your Rust \\nprograms; a few have no current functionality associated with them but have \\nbeen reserved for functionality that might be added to Rust in the future. You can find a list of the keywords in Appendix A.\\nVariables and Mutability\\nAs mentioned in Chapter 2, by default variables are immutable. This is \\none of many nudges Rust gives you to write your code in a way that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that Rust offers. However, you still have the option to make your variables mutable. Let’s explore how and why Rust encourages you to favor immutability and why sometimes you might want to opt out.\\nWhen a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can’t \\nchange that value. To illustrate this, let’s generate a new project called vari -\\nables in your projects  directory by using \\ncargo new --bin variables .\\nThen, in your new variables  directory, open src/main.rs  and replace its \\ncode with the following code that won’t compile just yet:\\nfn main() {\\n    let x = 5;\\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {}\", x);\\n    x = 6;\\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {}\", x);\\n}\\nSave and run the program using cargo run . You should receive an error \\nmessage, as shown in this output:\\nerror[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x` --> src/main.rs:4:5\\n  |\\n2 |     let x = 5;\\n  |         - first assignment to `x`\\n3 |     println!(\"The value of x is: {}\", x);4 |     x = 6;\\n  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable\\nThis example shows how the compiler helps you find errors in your \\nprograms. Even though compiler errors can be frustrating, they only mean src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 62}, page_content='Common Programming Concepts    33your program isn’t safely doing what you want it to do yet; they do not  \\nmean that you’re not a good programmer! Experienced Rustaceans still \\nget compiler errors.\\nThe error message indicates that the cause of the error is that you \\ncannot assign twice to immutable variable x , because you tried to assign a \\nsecond value to the immutable x variable.\\nIt’s important that we get compile \\xadtime errors when we attempt to change \\na value that we previously designated as immutable because this very situation can lead to bugs. If one part of our code operates on the assumption that a value will never change and another part of our code changes that value, it’s possible that the first part of the code won’t do what it was designed to do. The cause of this kind of bug can be difficult to track down after the fact, especially when the second piece of code changes the value only sometimes .\\nIn Rust, the compiler guarantees that when you state that a value won’t \\nchange, it really won’t change. That means that when you’re reading and writing code, you don’t have to keep track of how and where a value might change. Your code is thus easier to reason through.\\nBut mutability can be very useful. Variables are immutable only by \\ndefault; as you did in Chapter 2, you can make them mutable by adding \\nmut in front of the variable name. In addition to allowing this value to \\nchange, mut conveys intent to future readers of the code by indicating \\nthat other parts of the code will be changing this variable value.\\nFor example, let’s change src/main.rs  to the following:\\nfn main() {\\n    let mut x = 5;\\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {}\", x);\\n    x = 6;\\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {}\", x);\\n}\\nWhen we run the program now, we get this:\\n$ cargo run   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)\\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.50 secs\\n     Running `target/debug/variables`\\nThe value of x is: 5\\nThe value of x is: 6\\nWe’re allowed to change the value that x binds to from 5 to 6 when mut is \\nused. In some cases, you’ll want to make a variable mutable because it makes \\nthe code more convenient to write than if it had only immutable variables.\\nThere are multiple trade \\xadoffs to consider in addition to the prevention \\nof bugs. For example, in cases where you’re using large data structures, mutating an instance in place may be faster than copying and returning newly allocated instances. With smaller data structures, creating new instances and writing in a more functional programming style may be easier to think through, so lower performance might be a worthwhile penalty for gaining that clarity.src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 63}, page_content='34   Chapter 3Differences Between Variables and Constants\\nBeing unable to change the value of a variable might have reminded you of \\nanother programming concept that most other languages have: constants . \\nLike immutable variables, constants are values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change, but there are a few differences between constants and variables. \\nFirst, you aren’t allowed to use \\nmut with constants. Constants aren’t just \\nimmutable by default—they’re always immutable. \\nYou declare constants using the const  keyword instead of the let keyword, \\nand the type of the value must  be annotated. We’re about to cover types and \\ntype annotations in “Data Types” on page 36, so don’t worry about the details right now. Just know that you must always annotate the type. \\nConstants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, \\nwhich makes them useful for values that many parts of the code need to know about. \\nThe last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expres\\xad\\nsion, not to the result of a function call or any other value that could only be computed at runtime.\\nHere’s an example of a constant declaration where the constant’s name \\nis \\nMAX_POINTS  and its value is set to 100,000. (Rust’s naming convention for \\nconstants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words):\\nconst MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;\\nConstants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the \\nscope they were declared in, making them a useful choice for values in your application domain that multiple parts of the program might need to know about, such as the maximum number of points any player of a game is allowed to earn or the speed of light.\\nNaming hardcoded values used throughout your program as constants \\nis useful in conveying the meaning of that value to future maintainers of the code. It also helps to have only one place in your code you would need to change if the hardcoded value needed to be updated in the future.\\nShadowing\\nAs you saw in the guessing game tutorial in “Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number” on page 23, you can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, and the new variable shadows the previous vari \\xad\\nable. Rustaceans say that the first variable is shadowed  by the second, which \\nmeans that the second variable’s value is what appears when the variable is used. We can shadow a variable by using the same variable’s name and repeating the use of the \\nlet keyword as follows:\\nfn main() {\\n    let x = 5;\\n    let x = x + 1;au: moved box. \\nokay here?\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 64}, page_content='Common Programming Concepts    35    let x = x * 2;\\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {}\", x);\\n}\\nThis program first binds x to a value of 5. Then it shadows x by repeating \\nlet x = , taking the original value and adding 1 so the value of x is then 6. The \\nthird let statement also shadows x, multiplying the previous value by 2 to give \\nx a final value of 12. When we run this program, it will output the following:\\n$ cargo run   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)\\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.50 secs\\n     Running `target/debug/variables`\\nThe value of x is: 12\\nShadowing is different than marking a variable as mut, because we’ll get \\na compile \\xadtime error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without \\nusing the let keyword. By using let, we can perform a few transformations on \\na value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have \\nbeen completed.\\nThe other difference between mut and shadowing is that because we’re \\neffectively creating a new variable when we use the let keyword again, we \\ncan change the type of the value but reuse the same name. For example, say our program asks a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by inputting space characters, but we really want to store that input as a number:\\nlet spaces = \"   \";\\nlet spaces = spaces.len();\\nThis construct is allowed because the first spaces  variable is a string type \\nand the second spaces  variable, which is a brand \\xadnew variable that happens \\nto have the same name as the first one, is a number type. Shadowing thus \\nspares us from having to come up with different names, such as spaces_str  \\nand spaces_num ; instead, we can reuse the simpler spaces  name. However, if \\nwe try to use mut for this, as shown here, we’ll get a compile \\xadtime error:\\nlet mut spaces = \"   \";\\nspaces = spaces.len();\\nThe error says we’re not allowed to mutate a variable’s type:\\nerror[E0308]: mismatched types --> src/main.rs:3:14\\n  |\\n3 |     spaces = spaces.len();\\n  |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected &str, found usize\\n  |\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

We’ll look at \\ntwo data type subsets: scalar and compound.\\nKeep in mind that Rust is a statically typed  language, which means \\nthat it must know the types of all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it. In cases when many types are possible, such as when we converted a \\nString  to a numeric type using parse  in “Comparing the Guess to the Secret \\nNumber” on page 23, we must add a type annotation, like this:\\nlet guess: u32 = \"42\".parse().expect(\"Not a number!\");\\nIf we don’t add the type annotation here, Rust will display the following \\nerror, which means the compiler needs more information from us to know which type we want to use:\\nerror[E0282]: type annotations needed\\n --> src/main.rs:2:9\\n  |\\n2 |     let guess = \"42\".parse().expect(\"Not a number!\");\\n  |         ^^^^^\\n  |         |  |         cannot infer type for `_`\\n  |         consider giving `guess` a type\\nYou’ll see different type annotations for other data types.\\nScalar Types\\nA scalar  type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: \\nintegers, floating \\xadpoint numbers, Booleans, and characters. You may recog \\xad\\nnize these from other programming languages. Let’s jump into how they \\nwork in Rust.\\nInteger Types\\nAn integer  is a number without a fractional component. We used one integer \\ntype in Chapter 2, the u32 type. This type declaration indicates that the value \\nit’s associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types start \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Signed and unsigned  refer to whether it’s possible for the number to be \\nnegative or positive—in other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it (signed) or whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be represented without a sign (unsigned). It’s like writing numbers on paper: when the sign matters, a number is shown with a plus sign or a minus sign; however, when it’s safe to assume the number is positive, it’s shown with no sign. Signed numbers are stored using two’s complement representation (if you’re unsure what this is, you can search for it online; an explanation is outside the scope of this book).\\nEach signed variant can store numbers from − (2\\nn − 1) to 2n − 1 − 1 inclu \\xad\\nsive, where n is the number of bits that variant uses. So an i8 can store num \\xad\\nbers from − (27) to 27 − 1, which equals − 128 to 127. Unsigned variants can \\nstore numbers from 0 to 2n − 1, so a u8 can store numbers from 0 to 28 − 1, \\nwhich equals 0 to 255.\\nAdditionally, the isize  and usize  types depend on the kind of computer \\nyour program is running on: 64 bits if you’re on a 64 \\xadbit architecture and \\n32 bits if you’re on a 32 \\xadbit architecture.\\nYou can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in Table 3 \\xad2. Note \\nthat all number literals except the byte literal allow a type suffix, such as 57u8, \\nand _ as a visual separator, such as 1_000 .\\nTable 3-2: Integer Literals in Rust\\nNumber literals Example\\nDecimal 98_222\\nHex 0xff\\nOctal 0o77\\nBinary 0b1111_0000\\nByte (u8 only) b'A'\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir\"),\n",

If you’re unsure, Rust’s \\ndefaults are generally good choices, and integer types default to i32: this type \\nis generally the fastest, even on 64 \\xadbit systems. The primary situation in which \\nyou’d use isize  or usize  is when indexing some sort of collection.\\nFloating-Point Types\\nRust also has two primitive types for floating-point numbers , which are \\nnumbers with decimal points. Rust’s floating \\xadpoint types are f32 and f64, \\nwhich are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is f64 \\nbecause on modern CPUs it’s roughly the same speed as f32 but is capable \\nof more precision. \\nHere’s an example that shows floating \\xadpoint numbers in action:\\nfn main() {\\n    let x = 2.0; // f64\\n    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32\\n}\\nFloating \\xadpoint numbers are represented according to the IEEE \\xad754 stan \\xad\\ndard. The f32 type is a single \\xadprecision float, and f64 has double precision.\\nNumeric Operations\\nRust supports the basic mathematical operations you’d expect for all of the \\nnumber types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. The following code shows how you’d use each one in a \\nlet statement:\\nfn main() {\\n    // addition\\n    let sum = 5 + 10;\\n    // subtraction\\n    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;\\n    // multiplication\\n    let product = 4 * 30;\\n    // division\\n    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;\\n    // remainder\\n    let remainder = 43 % 5;\\n}\\nEach expression in these statements uses a mathematical operator and \\nevaluates to a single value, which is then bound to a variable. Appendix B \\ncontains a list of all operators that Rust provides.src/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 68}, page_content=\"Common Programming Concepts    39The Boolean Type\\nAs in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two \\npossible values: true and false . The Boolean type in Rust is specified using \\nbool. For example:\\nfn main() {\\n    let t = true;\\n    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation\\n}\\nThe main way to use Boolean values is through conditionals, such as an \\nif expression. We’ll cover how if expressions work in Rust in “Control Flow” \\non page 48.\\nThe Character Type\\nSo far we’ve worked only with numbers, but Rust supports letters too. Rust’s \\nchar type is the language’s most primitive alphabetic type, and the following \\ncode shows one way to use it. (Note that the char type is specified with single \\nquotes, as opposed to strings, which use double quotes.)\\nfn main() {\\n   let c = 'z';\\n   let z = ' Ƶ';\\n   let heart_eyed_cat = '😻 ';\\n}\\nRust’s char type represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can \\nrepresent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, \\nand Korean characters; emoji; and zero \\xadwidth spaces are all valid char \\nvalues in Rust. Unicode Scalar Values range from U+0000  to U+D7FF  and \\nU+E000  to U+10FFFF  inclusive. However, a “character” isn’t really a concept in \\nUnicode, so your human intuition for what a “character” is may not match up with what a \\nchar is in Rust. We’ll discuss this topic in detail in “Storing \\nUTF \\xad8 Encoded Text with Strings” on page 135.\\nCompound Types\\nCompound types  can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two \\nprimitive compound types: tuples and arrays.\\nThe Tuple Type\\nA tuple is a general way of grouping together some number of other values \\nwith a variety of types into one compound type.src/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir\"),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 69}, page_content='40   Chapter 3We create a tuple by writing a comma \\xadseparated list of values inside \\nparentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the dif \\xad\\nferent values in the tuple don’t have to be the same. We’ve added optional \\ntype annotations in this example:\\nfn main() {\\n    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);\\n}\\nThe variable tup binds to the entire tuple, because a tuple is considered \\na single compound element. To get the individual values out of a tuple, we \\ncan use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:\\nfn main() {\\n    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);\\n    let (x, y, z) = tup;    println!(\"The value of y is: {}\", y);\\n}\\nThis program first creates a tuple and binds it to the variable tup. It then \\nuses a pattern with let to take tup and turn it into three separate variables, \\nx, y, and z. This is called destructuring , because it breaks the single tuple into \\nthree parts. Finally, the program prints the value of y, which is 6.4.\\nIn addition to destructuring through pattern matching, we can access \\na tuple element directly by using a period ( .) followed by the index of the \\nvalue we want to access. For example:\\nfn main() {    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);\\n    let five_hundred = x.0;    let six_point_four = x.1;    let one = x.2;\\n}\\nThis program creates a tuple, x, and then makes new variables for each \\nelement by using their index. As with most programming languages, the \\nfirst index in a tuple is 0.\\nThe Array Type\\nAnother way to have a collection of multiple values is with an array . Unlike a \\ntuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Arrays in Rust are \\ndifferent from arrays in some other languages because arrays in Rust have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size. src/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 70}, page_content='Common Programming Concepts    41In Rust, the values going into an array are written as a comma \\xadseparated \\nlist inside square brackets:\\nfn main() {\\n    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\\n}\\nArrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather \\nthan the heap (we will discuss the stack and the heap more in Chapter 4) \\nor when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements. An array isn’t as flexible as the vector type, though. A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that is  allowed to grow \\nor shrink in size. If you’re unsure whether to use an array or a vector, you should probably use a vector. Chapter 8 discusses vectors in more detail.\\nAn example of when you might want to use an array rather than a \\nvector is in a program that needs to know the names of the months of the year. It’s very unlikely that such a program will need to add or remove months, so you can use an array because you know it will always contain 12 items:\\nlet months = [\"January\", \"February\", \"March\", \"April\", \"May\", \"June\", \"July\",\\n              \"August\", \"September\", \"October\", \"November\", \"December\"];\\nAccessing Array Elements\\nAn array is a single chunk of memory allocated on the stack. You can access \\nelements of an array using indexing, like this:\\nfn main() {\\n    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\\n    let first = a[0];\\n    let second = a[1];\\n}\\nIn this example, the variable named first  will get the value 1, because \\nthat is the value at index [0] in the array. The variable named second  will get \\nthe value 2 from index [1] in the array.\\nInvalid Array Element Access\\nWhat happens if you try to access an element of an array that is past the end \\nof the array? Say you change the example to the following code, which will compile but exit with an error when it runs:\\nfn main() {\\n    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\\n    let index = 10;\\n    let element = a[index];src/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

When you attempt to access \\nan element using indexing, Rust will check that the index you’ve specified is \\nless than the array length. If the index is greater than the length, Rust will panic , which is the term Rust uses when a program exits with an error.\\nThis is the first example of Rust’s safety principles in action. In many \\nlow\\xadlevel languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an \\nincorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed. Rust protects you against this kind of error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory access and continuing. Chapter 9 discusses more of Rust’s error handling.\\nFunctions\\nFunctions are pervasive in Rust code. You’ve already seen one of the most important functions in the language: the \\nmain function, which is the entry \\npoint of many programs. You’ve also seen the fn keyword, which allows you \\nto declare new functions.\\nRust code uses snake case  as the conventional style for function and vari \\xad\\nable names. In snake case, all letters are lowercase and underscores sepa \\xad\\nrate words. Here’s a program that contains an example function definition:\\nfn main() {\\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\\n    another_function();\\n}\\nfn another_function() {\\n    println!(\"Another function.\");\\n}\\nFunction definitions in Rust start with fn and have a set of parentheses \\nafter the function name. The curly brackets tell the compiler where the \\nfunction body begins and ends.\\nWe can call any function we’ve defined by entering its name followed \\nby a set of parentheses. Because another_function  is defined in the program, src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Note that we defined another \\n_function  after  the main function in the source code; we could have defined it \\nbefore as well. Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions, only that \\nthey’re defined somewhere.\\nLet’s start a new binary project named functions  to explore functions \\nfurther. Place the another_function  example in src/main.rs  and run it. You \\nshould see the following output:\\n$ cargo run\\n   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)\\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.50 secs\\n     Running `target/debug/functions`\\nHello, world!Another function.\\nThe lines execute in the order in which they appear in the main function. \\nFirst, the “Hello, world!” message prints, and then another_function  is called \\nand its message is printed.\\nFunction Parameters\\nFunctions can also be defined to have parameters , which are special variables \\nthat are part of a function’s signature. When a function has parameters, you \\ncan provide it with concrete values for those parameters.

So far, we’ve only covered functions without an ending expression, but you have seen an expression as part of a statement. Because Rust is an expression \\xadbased language, this is an important distinction to \\nunderstand. Other languages don’t have the same distinctions, so let’s look at what statements and expressions are and how their differences affect the bodies of functions.\\nWe’ve actually already used statements and expressions. Statements  are \\ninstruc  tions that perform some action and do not return a value. Expressions  \\nevaluate to a resulting value. Let’s look at some examples.\\nCreating a variable and assigning a value to it with the \\nlet keyword is a \\nstatement. In Listing 3 \\xad1, let y = 6;  is a statement.src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 74}, page_content='Common Programming Concepts    45fn main() {\\n    let y = 6;\\n}\\nListing 3-1: A main function declaration containing one statement\\nFunction definitions are also statements; the entire preceding example \\nis a statement in itself.\\nStatements do not return values. Therefore, you can’t assign a let state \\xad\\nment to another variable, as the following code tries to do; you’ll get an error:\\nfn main() {\\n    let x = (let y = 6);\\n}\\nWhen you run this program, the error you’ll get looks like this:\\n$ cargo run\\n   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)\\nerror: expected expression, found statement (`let`)\\n --> src/main.rs:2:14\\n  |\\n2 |     let x = (let y = 6);  |              ^^^\\n  |\\n  = note: variable declaration using `let` is a statement\\nThe let y = 6  statement does not return a value, so there isn’t anything \\nfor x to bind to. This is different from what happens in other languages, such \\nas C and Ruby, where the assignment returns the value of the assignment. In \\nthose languages, you can write x = y = 6  and have both x and y contain the \\nvalue 6; that is not the case in Rust.\\nExpressions evaluate to something and make up most of the rest of \\nthe code that you’ll write in Rust. Consider a simple math operation, such as \\n5 + 6 , which is an expression that evaluates to the value 11. Expressions \\ncan be part of statements: in Listing 3 \\xad1, the 6 in the statement let y = 6;  is \\nan expression that evaluates to the value 6. Calling a function is an expres \\xad\\nsion. Calling a macro is an expression. The block that we use to create new scopes, \\n{}, is an expression, for example:\\nfn main() {\\n    let x = 5;\\n    \\uf075 let y = {v \\n        let x = 3;\\n        w x + 1\\n    };\\n    println!(\"The value of y is: {}\", y);\\n}src/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 75}, page_content='46   Chapter 3The expression v  is a block that, in this case, evaluates to 4. That \\nvalue gets bound to y as part of the let statement \\uf075 . Note the line without \\na semicolon at the end w , which is unlike most of the lines you’ve seen so \\nfar. Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon \\nto the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, which will then not return a value. Keep this in mind as you explore function return values and expressions next.\\nFunctions with Return Values\\nFunctions can return values to the code that calls them. We don’t name return values, but we do declare their type after an arrow (\\n->). In Rust, \\nthe return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in the block of the body of a function. You can return early from a function by using the \\nreturn  keyword and specifying a value, but \\nmost functions return the last expression implicitly. Here’s an example of a function that returns a value:\\nfn five() -> i32 {\\n    5\\n}\\nfn main() {\\n    let x = five();\\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {}\", x);\\n}\\nThere are no function calls, macros, or even let statements in the five \\nfunction—just the number 5 by itself. That’s a perfectly valid function in \\nRust. Note that the function’s return type is specified, too, as -> i32 . Try \\nrunning this code; the output should look like this:\\n$ cargo run   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)\\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.50 secs\\n     Running `target/debug/functions`\\nThe value of x is: 5\\nThe 5 in five is the function’s return value, which is why the return type \\nis i32. Let’s examine this in more detail. There are two important bits: first, \\nthe line let x = five();  shows that we’re using the return value of a function \\nto initialize a variable. Because the function five returns a 5, that line is the \\nsame as the following:\\nlet x = 5;\\nSecond, the five function has no parameters and defines the type of \\nthe return value, but the body of the function is a lonely 5 with no semi \\xad\\ncolon because it’s an expression whose value we want to return. src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The definition of the function plus_one  says that it will return \\nan i32, but statements don’t evaluate to a value, which is expressed by (), the \\nempty tuple. Therefore, nothing is returned, which contradicts the function \\ndefinition and results in an error.

Even in situations in which you want to run some code a certain number of times, as in the countdown example that used a \\nwhile  loop in Listing 3 \\xad3, most Rustaceans would use a for loop. The \\nway to do that would be to use a Range , which is a type provided by the stan \\xad\\ndard library that generates all numbers in sequence starting from one num \\xad\\nber and ending before another number.\\nHere’s what the countdown would look like using a for loop and \\nanother method we’ve not yet talked about, rev, to reverse the range:\\nfn main() {\\n    for number in (1..4).rev() {\\n        println!(\"{}!\", number);\\n    }\\n    println!(\"LIFTOFF!!!\");\\n}\\nThis code is a bit nicer, isn’t it?src/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Therefore, it’s important to understand \\nhow ownership works in Rust. In this chapter, we’ll \\ntalk about ownership as well as several related fea -\\ntures: borrowing, slices, and how Rust lays data out in memory.\\nWhat Is Ownership?\\nRust’s central feature is ownership . Although the feature is straightforward \\nto explain, it has deep implications for the rest of the language.\\nAll programs have to manage the way they use a computer’s memory \\nwhile running. Some languages have garbage collection that constantly \\nlooks for no longer used memory as the program runs; in other languages, \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Rust uses a \\nthird approach: memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time. None of the owner -\\nship features slow down your program while it’s running.\\nBecause ownership is a new concept for many programmers, it does take \\nsome time to get used to. The good news is that the more experienced you become with Rust and the rules of the ownership system, the more you’ll be able to naturally develop code that is safe and efficient. Keep at it!\\nWhen you understand ownership, you’ll have a solid foundation for \\nunderstanding the features that make Rust unique. In this chapter, you’ll learn ownership by working through some examples that focus on a very common data structure: strings.\\nthe s tack and the h eap\\nIn many programming languages, you don’t have to think about the stack and \\nthe heap very often. But in a systems programming language like Rust, whether \\na value is on the stack or the heap has more of an effect on how the language \\nbehaves and why you have to make certain decisions. Parts of ownership will \\nbe described in relation to the stack and the heap later in this chapter, so here \\nis a brief explanation in preparation.\\nBoth the stack and the heap are parts of memory that is available to your \\ncode to use at runtime, but they are structured in different ways. The stack stores \\nvalues in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order. This \\nis referred to as last in, first out . Think of a stack of plates: when you add more \\nplates, you put them on top of the pile, and when you need a plate, you take one off the top. Adding or removing plates from the middle or bottom wouldn’t \\nwork as well! Adding data is called pushing onto the stack , and removing data \\nis called popping off the stack .\\nThe stack is fast because of the way it accesses the data: it never has to \\nsearch for a place to put new data or a place to get data from because that place is always the top. Another property that makes the stack fast is that all \\ndata on the stack must take up a known, fixed size.\\nData with a size unknown at compile time or a size that might change can \\nbe stored on the heap instead. The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you ask for some amount of space. The operating system finds \\nan empty spot somewhere in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in \\nuse, and returns a pointer , which is the address of that location. This process \\nis called allocating on the heap , sometimes abbreviated as just “allocating.” \\nPushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating. Because the pointer \\nis a known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you \\nwant the actual data, you have to follow the pointer.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 88}, page_content='Understanding Ownership    59Ownership Rules\\nFirst, let’s take a look at the ownership rules. Keep these rules in mind as we \\nwork through the examples that illustrate them:\\n•\\tEach value in Rust has a variable that’s called its owner .\\n•\\tThere can be only one owner at a time.\\n•\\tWhen the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.\\nVariable Scope\\nWe’ve walked through an example of a Rust program already in Chapter 2. \\nNow that we’re past basic syntax, we won’t include all the fn main() {  code \\nin examples, so if you’re following along, you’ll have to put the following examples inside a \\nmain function manually. As a result, our examples will \\nbe a bit more concise, letting us focus on the details rather than boiler -\\nplate code.Think of being seated at a restaurant. When you enter, you state the num -\\nber of people in your group, and the staff finds an empty table that fits every -\\none and leads you there. If someone in your group comes late, they can ask \\nwhere you’ve been seated to find you.\\nAccessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack \\nbecause you have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary processors are \\nfaster if they jump around less in memory. Continuing the analogy, consider a \\nserver at a restaurant taking orders from many tables. It’s most efficient to get all the orders at one table before moving on to the next table. Taking an order from \\ntable A, then an order from table B, then one from A again, and then one from \\nB again would be a much slower process. By the same token, a processor can \\ndo its job better if it works on data that’s close to other data (as it is on the stack) \\nrather than farther away (as it can be on the heap). Allocating a large amount of \\nspace on the heap can also take time.\\nWhen your code calls a function, the values passed into the function \\n(including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s local \\nvariables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those values \\nget popped off the stack.\\nKeeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap, \\nminimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused \\ndata on the heap so you don’t run out of space are all problems that ownership \\naddresses. Once you understand ownership, you won’t need to think about the \\nstack and the heap very often, but knowing that managing heap data is why ownership exists can help explain why it works the way it does.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 89}, page_content='60   Chapter 4As a first example of ownership, we’ll look at the scope  of some variables. \\nA scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid. Let’s say \\nwe have a variable that looks like this:\\nlet s = \"hello\";\\nThe variable s refers to a string literal, where the value of the string \\nis hardcoded into the text of our program. The variable is valid from the point at which it’s declared until the end of the current scope . Listing 4-1 \\nhas comments annotating where the variable \\ns is valid.\\n{                      // s is not valid here; it\\'s not yet declared\\n    let s = \"hello\";   // s is valid from this point forward\\n    // do stuff with s\\n}                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid\\nListing 4-1: A variable and the scope in which it is valid\\nIn other words, there are two important points in time here:\\n•\\tWhen s comes into scope , it is valid.\\n•\\tIt remains valid until it goes out of scope .\\nAt this point, the relationship between scopes and when variables are \\nvalid is similar to that in other programming languages. Now we’ll build on \\ntop of this understanding by introducing the String  type.\\nThe String Type\\nTo illustrate the rules of ownership, we need a data type that is more complex than the ones we covered in “Data Types” on page 36. The types covered previously are all stored on the stack and popped off the stack when their scope is over, but we want to look at data that is stored on the heap and explore how Rust knows when to clean up that data.\\nWe’ll use \\nString  as the example here and concentrate on the parts of \\nString  that relate to ownership. These aspects also apply to other complex \\ndata types provided by the standard library and that you create. We’ll dis -\\ncuss String  in more depth in Chapter 8.\\nWe’ve already seen string literals, where a string value is hardcoded into \\nour program. String literals are convenient, but they aren’t suitable for every situation in which we may want to use text. One reason is that they’re immu -\\ntable. Another is that not every string value can be known when we write our code: for example, what if we want to take user input and store it? For these situations, Rust has a second string type, \\nString . This type is allocated \\non the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that is unknown to us at compile time. You can create a \\nString  from a string literal using the \\nfrom function, like so:\\nlet s = String::from(\"hello\");\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 90}, page_content='Understanding Ownership    61The double colon ( ::) is an operator that allows us to namespace this \\nparticular from function under the String  type rather than using some sort of \\nname like string_from . We’ll discuss this syntax more in “Method Syntax” on \\npage 90 and when we talk about namespacing with modules in “Module \\nDefinitions” on page 111.\\nThis kind of string can  be mutated:\\nlet mut s = String::from(\"hello\");\\ns.push_str(\", world!\"); // push_str() appends a literal to a Stringprintln!(\"{}\", s); // this will print `hello, world!`\\nSo, what’s the difference here? Why can String  be mutated but literals \\ncannot? The difference is how these two types deal with memory.\\nMemory and Allocation\\nIn the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time, so \\nthe text is hardcoded directly into the final executable. This is why string literals are fast and efficient. But these properties only come from the string literal’s immutability. Unfortunately, we can’t put a blob of memory into the binary for each piece of text whose size is unknown at compile time and whose size might change while running the program.\\nWith the \\nString  type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of \\ntext, we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold the contents. This means:\\n•\\tThe memory must be requested from the operating system at runtime.\\n•\\tWe need a way of returning this memory to the operating system when \\nwe’re done with our \\nString .\\nThat first part is done by us: when we call String::from , its implementa -\\ntion requests the memory it needs. This is pretty much universal in pro -\\ngramming languages.\\nHowever, the second part is different. In languages with a garbage collector  \\n(GC) , the GC keeps track and cleans up memory that isn’t being used any -\\nmore, and we don’t need to think about it. Without a GC, it’s our respon -\\nsibility to identify when memory is no longer being used and call code to explicitly return it, just as we did to request it. Doing this correctly has histori -\\ncally been a difficult programming problem. If we forget, we’ll waste memory. If we do it too early, we’ll have an invalid variable. If we do it twice, that’s a bug too. We need to pair exactly one \\nallocate  with exactly one free.\\nRust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once \\nthe variable that owns it goes out of scope. Here’s a version of our scope example from Listing 4-1 using a \\nString  instead of a string literal:\\n{\\n    let s = String::from(\"hello\"); // s is valid from this point forward\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

When a variable \\ngoes out of scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is \\ncalled drop, and it’s where the author of String  can put the code to return \\nthe memory. Rust calls drop automatically at the closing curly bracket.\\nnO te In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item’s lifetime is some -\\ntimes called Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) . The drop function in \\nRust will be familiar to you if you’ve used RAII patterns.\\nThis pattern has a profound impact on the way Rust code is written. It \\nmay seem simple right now, but the behavior of code can be unexpected in more complicated situations when we want to have multiple variables use the data we’ve allocated on the heap. Let’s explore some of those situations now.\\nWays That Variables and Data Interact: Move\\nMultiple variables can interact with the same data in different ways in Rust. \\nLet’s look at an example using an integer in Listing 4-2.\\nlet x = 5;\\nlet y = x;\\nListing 4-2: Assigning the integer value of variable x to y\\nWe can probably guess what this is doing: “bind the value 5 to x; then \\nmake a copy of the value in x and bind it to y.” We now have two variables, x \\nand y, and both equal 5. This is indeed what is happening, because integers \\nare simple values with a known, fixed size and these two 5 values are pushed \\nonto the stack.\\nNow let’s look at the String  version:\\nlet s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\\nlet s2 = s1;\\nThis looks very similar to the previous code, so we might assume that \\nthe way it works would be the same: that is, the second line would make a \\ncopy of the value in s1 and bind it to s2. But this isn’t quite what happens.\\nTake a look at Figure 4-1 to see what is happening to String  under the \\ncovers. A String  is made up of three parts, shown on the left: a pointer to \\nthe memory that holds the contents of the string, a length, and a capacity. This group of data is stored on the stack. On the right is the memory on the heap that holds the contents.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 92}, page_content='Understanding Ownership    63The length is how much \\nmemory, in bytes, the contents \\nof the String  is currently using. \\nThe capacity is the total amount of memory, in bytes, that the \\nString  \\nhas received from the operating system. The difference between length and capacity matters, but not in this context, so for now, it’s fine to ignore the capacity.\\nWhen we assign \\ns1 to s2, the \\nString  data is copied, meaning we \\ncopy the pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the data on the heap that the pointer refers to. In other words, the data representation in memory looks like Figure 4-2.\\nThe representation does not  look like Figure 4-3, which is what memory \\nwould look like if Rust instead copied the heap data as well. If Rust did this, the operation \\ns2 = s1  could be very expensive in terms of runtime perfor -\\nmance if the data on the heap were large.\\nEarlier, we said that when a variable goes out of scope, Rust automati -\\ncally calls the drop function and cleans up the heap memory for that variable. \\nBut Figure 4-2 shows both data pointers pointing to the same location. This is a problem: when \\ns2 and s1 go out of scope, they will both try to free the same \\nmemory. This is known as a double free  error and is one of the memory safety \\nbugs we mentioned previously. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory corruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.Figure 4-2: Representation in memory \\nof the variable s2 that has a copy of the \\npointer, length, and capacity of s1s1\\nname value\\nptr\\nlen 5\\ncapacity 5index value\\n0h\\n1e\\n2l3l\\n4os2\\nname value\\nptr\\nlen 5\\ncapacity 5index value\\n0h\\n1e\\n2l\\n3l\\n4o\\nFigure 4-3: Another possibility for what \\ns2 = s1  might do if Rust copied the \\nheap data as wellFigure 4-1: Representation in memory of a \\nString  holding the value \"hello\"  \\nbound to s1s1\\nname value\\nptr\\nlen 5\\ncapacity 5index value\\n0h\\n1e\\n2l\\n3l\\n4o\\ns1\\nname value\\nptr\\nlen 5\\ncapacity 5\\ns2\\nname value\\nptr\\nlen 5\\ncapacity 5index value\\n0h\\n1e\\n2l\\n3l\\n4o\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Instead of trying to copy the allocated memory, Rust \\nconsiders s1 to no longer be valid and, therefore, Rust doesn’t need to free \\nanything when s1 goes out of scope. Check out what happens when you try \\nto use s1 after s2 is created; it won’t work:\\nlet s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\\nlet s2 = s1;\\nprintln!(\"{}, world!\", s1);\\nYou’ll get an error like this because Rust prevents you from using the \\ninvalidated reference:\\nerror[E0382]: use of moved value: `s1`\\n --> src/main.rs:5:28\\n  |\\n3 |     let s2 = s1;\\n  |         -- value moved here\\n4 |5 |     println!(\"{}, world!\", s1);\\n  |                            ^^ value used here after move\\n  |\\n  = note: move occurs because `s1` has type `std::string::String`, which does \\nnot implement the `Copy` trait\\nIf you’ve heard the terms s hallow  \\ncopy and deep copy  while working with \\nother languages, the concept of copy -\\ning the pointer, length, and capacity \\nwithout copying the data probably sounds like making a shallow copy. But because Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of being called a shallow copy, it’s known as a move . \\nIn this example, we would say that \\ns1 \\nwas moved into s2. So what actually \\nhappens is shown in Figure 4-4.\\nThat solves our problem! With \\nonly s2 valid, when it goes out of \\nscope, it alone will free the memory, and we’re done.\\nIn addition, there’s a design choice that’s implied by this: Rust will \\nnever automatically create “deep” copies of your data. Therefore, any automatic  copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime \\nperformance.s1\\nname value\\nptr\\nlen 5\\ncapacity 5\\ns2\\nname value\\nptr\\nlen 5\\ncapacity 5index value\\n0h\\n1e\\n2l\\n3l\\n4o\\nFigure 4-4: Representation in memory \\nafter s1 has been invalidated\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

We’ll discuss method syn -\\ntax in Chapter 5, but because methods are a common feature in many pro -\\ngramming languages, you’ve probably seen them before.\\nHere’s an example of the clone  method in action:\\nlet s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\\nlet s2 = s1.clone();\\nprintln!(\"s1 = {}, s2 = {}\", s1, s2);\\nThis works just fine and explicitly produces the behavior shown in \\nFigure 4-3, where the heap data does  get copied.\\nWhen you see a call to clone , you know that some arbitrary code is being \\nexecuted and that code may be expensive. It’s a visual indicator that some -\\nthing different is going on.\\nStack-Only Data: Copy\\nThere’s another wrinkle we haven’t talked about yet. This code using integers, \\npart of which was shown in Listing 4-2, works and is valid:\\nlet x = 5;\\nlet y = x;\\nprintln!(\"x = {}, y = {}\", x, y);\\nBut this code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don’t have a \\ncall to clone , but x is still valid and wasn’t moved into y.\\nThe reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at com -\\npile time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are \\nquick to make. That means there’s no reason we would want to prevent x \\nfrom being valid after we create the variable y. In other words, there’s no dif -\\nference between deep and shallow copying here, so calling clone  wouldn’t do \\nanything different from the usual shallow copying and we can leave it out.\\nRust has a special annotation called the Copy trait that we can place on \\ntypes like integers that are stored on the stack (we’ll talk more about traits in Chapter 10). If a type has the \\nCopy trait, an older variable is still usable \\nafter assignment. Rust won’t let us annotate a type with the Copy trait if the \\ntype, or any of its parts, has implemented the Drop trait. If the type needs \\nsomething special to happen when the value goes out of scope and we add the \\nCopy annotation to that type, we’ll get a compile-time error.

Slices let you \\nreference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the \\nwhole collection.\\nHere’s a small programming problem: write a function that takes a string \\nand returns the first word it finds in that string. If the function doesn’t find a space in the string, the whole string must be one word, so the entire string should be returned.\\nLet’s think about the signature of this function:\\nfn first_word(s: &String) -> ?\\nThis function, first_word , has a &String  as a parameter. We don’t want \\nownership, so this is fine. But what should we return? We don’t really have a way to talk about part  of a string. However, we could return the index of the \\nend of the word.

Next, we create an iterator over the array of bytes \\nusing the iter method \\uf077 .\\nWe’ll discuss iterators in more detail in Chapter 13. For now, know that \\niter is a method that returns each element in a collection and that enumerate  \\nwraps the result of iter and returns each element as part of a tuple instead. \\nThe first element of the tuple returned from enumerate  is the index, and the \\nsecond element is a reference to the element. This is a bit more convenient \\nthan calculating the index ourselves.\\nBecause the enumerate  method returns a tuple, we can use patterns to \\ndestructure that tuple, just like everywhere else in Rust. So in the for loop, \\nwe specify a pattern that has i for the index in the tuple and &item  for the \\nsingle byte in the tuple \\uf076 . Because we get a reference to the element from \\n.iter().enumerate() , we use & in the pattern.\\nInside the for loop, we search for the byte that represents the space by \\nusing the byte literal syntax \\uf078 . If we find a space, we return the position. \\nOtherwise, we return the length of the string by using s.len()  \\uf079.\\nWe now have a way to find out the index of the end of the first word in \\nthe string, but there’s a problem. We’re returning a usize  on its own, but \\nit’s only a meaningful number in the context of the &String . In other words, \\nbecause it’s a separate value from the String , there’s no guarantee that it \\nwill still be valid in the future.

Let’s move on to Chapter 5 and look at grouping pieces of data together in a \\nstruct .\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

If you’re familiar with an \\nobject-oriented language, a struct  is like an object’s \\ndata attributes. In this chapter, we’ll compare and \\ncontrast tuples with structs, demonstrate how to use structs, and discuss \\nhow to define methods and associated functions to specify behavior associ -\\nated with a struct’s data. Structs and enums (discussed in Chapter 6) are the building blocks for creating new types in your program’s domain to take full advantage of Rust’s compile time type checking.\\nDefining and Instantiating Structs\\nStructs are similar to tuples, which were discussed in Chapter 3. Like tuples, the pieces of a struct can be different types. Unlike with tuples, you’ll name each piece of data so it’s clear what the values mean. As a result of these \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

A struct’s name should describe the significance of the pieces of data being grouped together. Then, inside curly brackets, we define the names and types of the pieces of data, which we call fields . For example, \\nListing 5-1 shows a struct that stores information about a user account.\\nstruct User {\\n    username: String,\\n    email: String,\\n    sign_in_count: u64,\\n    active: bool,\\n}\\nListing 5-1: A User struct definition\\nTo use a struct after we’ve defined it, we create an instance  of that struct \\nby specifying concrete values for each of the fields. We create an instance by \\nstating the name of the struct and then add curly brackets containing key: \\nvalue  pairs, where the keys are the names of the fields and the values are the \\ndata we want to store in those fields. We don’t have to specify the fields in the same order in which we declared them in the struct. In other words, the struct definition is like a general template for the type, and instances fill in that template with particular data to create values of the type. For example, we can declare a particular user as shown in Listing 5-2.\\nlet user1 = User {\\n    email: String::from(\"someone@example.com\"),\\n    username: String::from(\"someusername123\"),\\n    active: true,\\n    sign_in_count: 1,\\n};\\nListing 5-2: Creating an instance of the User struct\\nTo get a specific value from a struct, we can use dot notation. If we wanted \\njust this user’s email address, we could use user1.email  wherever we wanted to \\nuse this value. If the instance is mutable, we can change a value by using the \\ndot notation and assigning into a particular field. Listing 5-3 shows how to change the value in the \\nemail  field of a mutable User instance.\\nlet mut user1 = User {\\n    email: String::from(\"someone@example.com\"),\\n    username: String::from(\"someusername123\"),\\n    active: true,\\n    sign_in_count: 1,\\n};\\nuser1.email = String::from(\"anotheremail@example.com\");\\nListing 5-3: Changing the value in the email  field of a User instance\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

You’ll do this using struct update syntax . \\nFirst, Listing 5-6 shows how we create a new User instance in user2  without \\nthe update syntax. We set new values for email  and username  but otherwise \\nuse the same values from user1  that we created in Listing 5-2.\\nlet user2 = User {\\n    email: String::from(\"another@example.com\"),\\n    username: String::from(\"anotherusername567\"),\\n    active: user1.active,\\n    sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,\\n};\\nListing 5-6: Creating a new User instance using some of the values from user1\\nUsing struct update syntax, we can achieve the same effect with less code, \\nas shown in Listing 5-7. The syntax .. specifies that the remaining fields not \\nexplicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance. \\nlet user2 = User {\\n    email: String::from(\"another@example.com\"),\\n    username: String::from(\"anotherusername567\"),\\n    ..user1\\n};\\nListing 5-7: Using struct update syntax to set new email  and username  values for a User \\ninstance but use the rest of the values from the fields of the instance in the user1  variable\\nThe code in Listing 5-7 also creates an instance in user2  that has a dif -\\nferent value for email  and username  but has the same values for the active  and \\nsign_in_count  fields from user1 .\\nUsing Tuple Structs Without Named Fields to Create Different Types\\nYou can also define structs that look similar to tuples, called tuple structs . \\nTuple structs have the added meaning the struct name provides but don’t \\nhave names associated with their fields; rather, they just have the types of the fields. Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name and make the tuple be a different type than other tuples, and naming each field as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant.\\nTo define a tuple struct, start with the \\nstruct  keyword and the struct \\nname followed by the types in the tuple. For example, here are definitions and usages of two tuple structs named \\nColor  and Point :\\nstruct Color(i32, i32, i32);\\nstruct Point(i32, i32, i32);\\nlet black = Color(0, 0, 0);\\nlet origin = Point(0, 0, 0);\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 114}, page_content='Using Structs to Structure Related Data    85Note that the black  and origin  values are different types, because they’re \\ninstances of different tuple structs. Each struct you define is its own type, \\neven though the fields within the struct have the same types. For example, a function that takes a parameter of type \\nColor  cannot take a Point  as an argu -\\nment, even though both types are made up of three i32 values. Otherwise, \\ntuple struct instances behave like tuples: you can destructure them into their individual pieces, you can use a \\n. followed by the index to access an \\nindividual value, and so on.\\nUnit-Like Structs Without Any Fields\\nYou can also define structs that don’t have any fields! These are called unit-like structs  because they behave similarly to \\n(), the unit type. Unit-like \\nstructs can be useful in situations in which you need to implement a trait on some type but don’t have any data that you want to store in the type itself. We’ll discuss traits in Chapter 10.\\nownership of s tr Uct d ata\\nIn the User struct definition in Listing 5-1, we use the owned String  type rather \\nthan the &str string slice type. This is a deliberate choice because we want \\ninstances of this struct to own all of its data and for that data to be valid for as \\nlong as the entire struct is valid.\\nIt’s possible for structs to store references to data owned by something \\nelse, but to do so requires the use of lifetimes , a Rust feature that we’ll discuss \\nin Chapter 10. Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct is valid for as long as the struct is. Let’s say you try to store a reference in a struct without \\nspecifying lifetimes, like this, which won’t work:\\nstruct User {\\n    username: &str,    email: &str,    sign_in_count: u64,    active: bool,}\\nfn main() {\\n    let user1 = User {        email: \"someone@example.com\",        username: \"someusername123\",        active: true,        sign_in_count: 1,    };}\\n(continued)src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

We’ll start with single variables, and then refactor the program until we’re using structs instead.\\nLet’s make a new binary project with Cargo called rectangles  that will \\ntake the width and height of a rectangle specified in pixels and calculate the area of the rectangle. Listing 5-8 shows a short program with one way of doing exactly that in our project’s src/main.rs .\\nfn main() {\\n    let width1 = 30;\\n    let height1 = 50;\\n    println!(\\n        \"The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.\",        area(width1, height1)\\n    );\\n}\\nfn area(width: u32, height: u32) -> u32 {\\n    width * height\\n}\\nListing 5-8: Calculating the area of a rectangle specified by separate width and height \\nvariables\\nNow, run this program using cargo run :\\nThe area of the rectangle is 1500 square pixels.src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Tuples let us add a bit of structure, and \\nwe’re now passing just one argument u .

We would have to keep in mind that \\nwidth  is the tuple index 0 and height  \\nis the tuple index 1. If someone else worked on this code, they would have to figure this out and keep it in mind as well. It would be easy to forget or mix up these values and cause errors, because we haven’t conveyed the meaning of our data in our code.\\nRefactoring with Structs: Adding More Meaning\\nWe use structs to add meaning by labeling the data.

Let’s look at how we can continue to refactor this code by turning the \\narea function into an area method  defined \\non our Rectangle  type.\\nMethod Syntax\\nMethods  are similar to functions: they’re declared with the fn keyword and \\ntheir name, they can have parameters and a return value, and they contain some code that is run when they’re called from somewhere else. However, methods are different from functions in that they’re defined within the con -\\ntext of a struct (or an enum or a trait object, which we cover in Chapters 6 and 17, respectively), and their first parameter is always \\nself, which represents \\nthe instance of the struct the method is being called on.\\nDefining Methods\\nLet’s change the area function that has a Rectangle  instance as a parameter \\nand instead make an area method defined on the Rectangle  struct, as shown \\nin Listing 5-13.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Then we move the area function within the impl \\ncurly brackets v and change the first (and in this case, only) parameter to \\nbe self in the signature and everywhere within the body. In main, where we \\ncalled the area function and passed rect1  as an argument, we can instead \\nuse method syntax  to call the area method on our Rectangle  instance \\uf077 . The \\nmethod syntax goes after an instance: we add a dot followed by the method name, parentheses, and any arguments.\\nIn the signature for \\narea, we use &self  instead of rectangle: &Rectangle  \\nbecause Rust knows the type of self is Rectangle  due to this method’s being \\ninside the impl Rectangle  context. Note that we still need to use the & before \\nself, just as we did in &Rectangle . Methods can take ownership of self, bor -\\nrow self immutably as we’ve done here, or borrow self mutably, just as they \\ncan any other parameter.\\nWe’ve chosen &self  here for the same reason we used &Rectangle  in the \\nfunction version: we don’t want to take ownership, and we just want to read the data in the struct, not write to it. If we wanted to change the instance that we’ve called the method on as part of what the method does, we’d use \\n&mut self  as the first parameter. Having a method that takes ownership of \\nthe instance by using just self as the first parameter is rare; this technique \\nis usually used when the method transforms self into something else and \\nyou want to prevent the caller from using the original instance after the transformation.\\nThe main benefit of using methods instead of functions, in addition \\nto using method syntax and not having to repeat the type of \\nself in every \\nmethod’s signature, is for organization.

In other words, if object  is a pointer, object->something()  is \\nsimilar to (*object).something() .\\nRust doesn’t have an equivalent to the -> operator; instead, Rust has a fea -\\nture called automatic referencing and dereferencing . Calling methods is one of \\nthe few places in Rust that has this behavior.\\nHere’s how it works: when you call a method with object.something() , \\nRust automatically adds in &, &mut, or * so object  matches the signature of the \\nmethod. In other words, the following are the same:\\np1.distance(&p2);\\n(&p1).distance(&p2);\\nThe first one looks much cleaner. This automatic referencing behavior works \\nbecause methods have a clear receiver—the type of self. Given the receiver \\nand name of a method, Rust can figure out definitively whether the method is \\nreading ( &self ), mutating ( &mut self ), or consuming ( self). The fact that Rust \\nmakes borrowing implicit for method receivers is a big part of making ownership ergonomic in practice.\\nMethods with More Parameters\\nLet’s practice using methods by implementing a second method on the \\nRectangle  struct. This time, we want an instance of Rectangle  to take another \\ninstance of Rectangle  and return true if the second Rectangle  can fit completely \\nwithin self; otherwise it should return false .

Let’s add the new can_hold  method to the impl block \\nfrom Listing 5-13, shown in Listing 5-15.\\nimpl Rectangle {\\n    fn area(&self) -> u32 {\\n        self.width * self.height\\n    }\\n    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {\\n        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height\\n    }\\n}\\nListing 5-15: Implementing the can_hold  method on Rectangle  that takes another Rectangle  \\ninstance as a parameter\\nWhen we run this code with the main function in Listing 5-14, we’ll get \\nour desired output. Methods can take multiple parameters that we add to \\nthe signature after the self parameter, and those parameters work just like \\nparameters in functions.\\nAssociated Functions\\nAnother useful feature of impl blocks is that we’re allowed to define \\nfunctions within impl blocks that don’t  take self as a parameter. These \\nare called associated functions  because they’re associated with the struct. \\nThey’re still functions, not methods, because they don’t have an instance of the struct to work with. You’ve already used the \\nString::from  associated \\nfunction.\\nAssociated functions are often used for constructors that will return \\na new instance of the struct. For example, we could provide an associated src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

This function is name -\\nspaced by the struct: the :: syntax is used for both associated functions and \\nnamespaces created by modules. We’ll discuss modules in Chapter 7.\\nMultiple impl Blocks\\nEach struct is allowed to have multiple impl blocks. For example, Listing 5-15 \\nis equivalent to the code shown in Listing 5-16, which has each method in its \\nown impl block.\\nimpl Rectangle {\\n    fn area(&self) -> u32 {\\n        self.width * self.height\\n    }\\n}\\nimpl Rectangle {\\n    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {\\n        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height\\n    }\\n}\\nListing 5-16: Rewriting Listing 5-15 using multiple impl blocks\\nThere’s no reason to separate these methods into multiple impl blocks \\nhere, but this is valid syntax. We’ll see a case in which multiple impl blocks \\nare useful in Chapter 10, where we discuss generic types and traits.\\nSummary\\nStructs let you create custom types that are meaningful for your domain. By \\nusing structs, you can keep associated pieces of data connected to each other and name each piece to make your code clear. Methods let you specify the behavior that instances of your structs have, and associated functions let you namespace functionality that is particular to your struct without having an instance available.\\nBut structs aren’t the only way you can create custom types: let’s turn to \\nRust’s enum feature to add another tool to your toolbox.src/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Say we need to work with IP addresses. Currently, two major standards are used for IP addresses: version four and version six. These are the only possibilities for an IP address that our program will come across: we can enumerate  all \\npossible values, which is where enumeration gets its name.\\nAny IP address can be either a version four or a version six address, but \\nnot both at the same time. That property of IP addresses makes the enum data structure appropriate, because enum values can only be one of the variants. Both version four and version six addresses are still fundamentally IP addresses, so they should be treated as the same type when the code is handling situations that apply to any kind of IP address.\\nWe can express this concept in code by defining an \\nIpAddrKind  enumera -\\ntion and listing the possible kinds an IP address can be, V4 and V6. These \\nare known as the variants  of the enum:\\nenum IpAddrKind {\\n    V4,\\n    V6,\\n}\\nIpAddrKind  is now a custom data type that we can use elsewhere in \\nour code.\\nEnum Values\\nWe can create instances of each of the two variants of IpAddrKind  like this:\\nlet four = IpAddrKind::V4;let six = IpAddrKind::V6;\\nNote that the variants of the enum are namespaced under its identifier, \\nand we use a double colon to separate the two. The reason this is useful \\nis that now both values IpAddrKind::V4  and IpAddrKind::V6  are of the same \\ntype: IpAddrKind . We can then, for instance, define a function that takes any \\nIpAddrKind :\\nfn route(ip_type: IpAddrKind) { }\\nAnd we can call this function with either variant:\\nroute(IpAddrKind::V4);\\nroute(IpAddrKind::V6);\\nUsing enums has even more advantages. Thinking more about our \\nIP address type, at the moment we don’t have a way to store the actual IP \\naddress data ; we only know what kind it is. Given that you just learned about \\nstructs in Chapter 5, you might tackle this problem as shown in Listing 6-1.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

We have two instances of this struct. The \\nfirst, home \\uf079, has the value IpAddrKind::V4  as its kind with associated address \\ndata of 127.0.0.1 . The second instance, loopback  \\uf07a, has the other variant of \\nIpAddrKind  as its kind value, V6, and has address ::1 associated with it. We’ve \\nused a struct to bundle the kind and address  values together, so now the vari -\\nant is associated with the value.\\nWe can represent the same concept in a more concise way using just \\nan enum, rather than an enum inside a struct, by putting data directly into \\neach enum variant. This new definition of the IpAddr  enum says that both V4 \\nand V6 variants will have associated String  values:\\nenum IpAddr {\\n    V4(String),\\n    V6(String),\\n}\\nlet home = IpAddr::V4(String::from(\"127.0.0.1\"));let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from(\"::1\"));\\nWe attach data to each variant of the enum directly, so there is no need \\nfor an extra struct.\\nThere’s another advantage to using an enum rather than a struct: each \\nvariant can have different types and amounts of associated data. Version \\nfour type IP addresses will always have four numeric components that will have values between 0 and 255. If we wanted to store \\nV4 addresses as four u8 \\nvalues but still express V6 addresses as one String  value, we wouldn’t be able \\nto with a struct.

However, as it turns out, wanting to \\nstore IP addresses and encode which kind they are is so common that the standard library has a definition we can use! Let’s look at how the standard library defines \\nIpAddr : it has the exact enum and variants that we’ve defined \\nand used, but it embeds the address data inside the variants in the form of two different structs, which are defined differently for each variant:\\nstruct Ipv4Addr {\\n    // --snip--\\n}\\nstruct Ipv6Addr {\\n    // --snip--}\\nenum IpAddr {\\n    V4(Ipv4Addr),\\n    V6(Ipv6Addr),\\n}\\nThis code illustrates that you can put any kind of data inside an enum \\nvariant: strings, numeric types, or structs, for example. You can even include \\nanother enum! Also, standard library types are often not much more compli -\\ncated than what you might come up with.\\nNote that even though the standard library contains a definition for \\nIpAddr , we can still create and use our own definition without conflict because \\nwe haven’t brought the standard library’s definition into our scope. We’ll talk more about bringing types into scope in Chapter 7.\\nLet’s look at another example of an enum in Listing 6-2: this one has a \\nwide variety of types embedded in its variants.\\nenum Message {\\n    Quit,\\n    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },\\n    Write(String),\\n    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),\\n}\\nListing 6-2: A Message  enum whose variants each store different amounts and types of values\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Here’s a method named call that we could define on \\nour Message  enum:\\nimpl Message {\\n    fn call(&self) {\\n        \\uf075 // method body would be defined here\\n    }\\n}\\n\\uf076 let m = Message::Write(String::from(\"hello\"));\\nm.call();\\nThe body of the method would use self to get the value that we called \\nthe method on.

The Option  type is used in many places because it \\nencodes the very common scenario in which a value could be something \\nor it could be nothing. Expressing this concept in terms of the type system means the compiler can check whether you’ve handled all the cases you should be handling; this functionality can prevent bugs that are extremely common in other programming languages.\\nProgramming language design is often thought of in terms of which \\nfeatures you include, but the features you exclude are important too. Rust doesn’t have the null feature that many other languages have. Null  is a value \\nthat means there is no value there. In languages with null, variables can always be in one of two states: null or not-null.\\nIn his 2009 presentation “Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake,” \\nTony Hoare, the inventor of null, has this to say:\\nI call it my billion dollar mistake. At that time, I was design -\\ning the first comprehensive type system for references in an \\nobject-oriented language. My goal was to ensure that all use of \\nreferences should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn’t resist the temptation \\nto put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to imple -\\nment. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and \\nsystem crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of \\npain and damage in the last forty years.\\nThe problem with null values is that if you try to use a null value as a \\nnot-null value, you’ll get an error of some kind. Because this null or not-null \\nproperty is pervasive, it’s extremely easy to make this kind of error.\\nHowever, the concept that null is trying to express is still a useful one: a \\nnull is a value that is currently invalid or absent for some reason.\\nThe problem isn’t really with the concept but with the particular imple -\\nmentation. As such, Rust does not have nulls, but it does have an enum that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent. This enum is \\nOption<T> , and it is defined by the standard library as follows:\\nenum Option<T> {\\n    Some(T),\\n    None,\\n}\\nThe Option<T>  enum is so useful that it’s even included in the prelude; \\nyou don’t need to bring it into scope explicitly. In addition, so are its vari -\\nants: you can use Some and None directly without the Option::  prefix. The \\nOption<T>  enum is still just a regular enum, and Some(T)  and None are still \\nvariants of type Option<T> .\\nThe <T> syntax is a feature of Rust we haven’t talked about yet. It’s a \\ngeneric type parameter, and we’ll cover generics in more detail in Chapter 10. \\nFor now, all you need to know is that <T> means the Some variant of the Option  \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Here are some examples of \\nusing Option  values to hold number types and string types:\\nlet some_number = Some(5);\\nlet some_string = Some(\"a string\");\\nlet absent_number: Option<i32> = None;\\nIf we use None rather than Some, we need to tell Rust what type of Option<T>  \\nwe have, because the compiler can’t infer the type that the Some variant will \\nhold by looking only at a None value.\\nWhen we have a Some value, we know that a value is present and the value \\nis held within the Some. When we have a None value, in some sense, it means the \\nsame thing as null: we don’t have a valid value. So why is having Option<T>  any \\nbetter than having null?\\nIn short, because Option<T>  and T (where T can be any type) are different \\ntypes, the compiler won’t let us use an Option<T>  value as if it were definitely \\na valid value. For example, this code won’t compile because it’s trying to \\nadd an i8 to an Option<i8> :\\nlet x: i8 = 5;\\nlet y: Option<i8> = Some(5);\\nlet sum = x + y;\\nIf we run this code, we get an error message like this:\\nerror[E0277]: the trait bound `i8: std::ops::Add<std::option::Option<i8>>` is \\nnot satisfied\\n -->\\n  |\\n5 |     let sum = x + y;\\n  |                 ^ no implementation for `i8 + std::option::Option<i8>`  |\\nIntense! In effect, this error message means that Rust doesn’t under -\\nstand how to add an i8 and an Option<i8> , because they’re different types. \\nWhen we have a value of a type like i8 in Rust, the compiler will ensure that \\nwe always have a valid value. We can proceed confidently without having \\nto check for null before using that value. Only when we have an Option<i8>  \\n(or whatever type of value we’re working with) do we have to worry about possibly not having a value, and the compiler will make sure we handle that case before using the value.\\nIn other words, you have to convert an \\nOption<T>  to a T before you can \\nper form T operations with it. Generally, this helps catch one of the most com -\\nmon issues with null: assuming that something isn’t null when it actually is. \\nNot having to worry about incorrectly assuming a not-null value helps \\nyou to be more confident in your code. In order to have a value that can possibly be null, you must explicitly opt in by making the type of that value \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Then, when you use that value, you are required to explicitly \\nhandle the case when the value is null. Everywhere that a value has a type \\nthat isn’t an Option<T> , you can  safely assume that the value isn’t null. This \\nwas a deliberate design decision for Rust to limit null’s pervasiveness and increase the safety of Rust code.\\nSo, how do you get the \\nT value out of a Some variant when you have a value \\nof type Option<T>  so you can use that value? The Option<T>  enum has a large \\nnumber of methods that are useful in a variety of situations; you can check them out in its documentation. Becoming familiar with the methods on \\nOption<T>  will be extremely useful in your journey with Rust.\\nIn general, in order to use an Option<T>  value, you want to have code that \\nwill handle each variant. You want some code that will run only when you have a \\nSome(T)  value, and this code is allowed to use the inner T. You want \\nsome other code to run if you have a None value, and that code doesn’t have \\na T value available. The match  expression is a control flow construct that does \\njust this when used with enums: it will run different code depending on which variant of the enum it has, and that code can use the data inside the matching value.\\nThe match Control Flow Operator\\nRust has an extremely powerful control flow operator called match  that allows \\nyou to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code based on which pattern matches. Patterns can be made up of literal values, variable names, wildcards, and many other things; Chapter 18 covers all the different kinds of patterns and what they do. The power of \\nmatch  comes from \\nthe expressiveness of the patterns and the fact that the compiler confirms that all possible cases are handled.\\nThink of a \\nmatch  expression as being like a coin-sorting machine: \\ncoins slide down a track with variously sized holes along it, and each coin falls through the first hole it encounters that it fits into. In the same way, values go through each pattern in a \\nmatch , and at the first pattern the \\nvalue “fits,” the value falls into the associated code block to be used dur -\\ning execution.\\nBecause we just mentioned coins, let’s use them as an example of using \\nmatch ! We can write a function that can take an unknown United States coin \\nand, in a similar way as the counting machine, determine which coin it is and return its value in cents, as shown here in Listing 6-3.\\n\\uf075 enum Coin {\\n    Penny,\\n    Nickel,\\n    Dime,\\n    Quarter,\\n}\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

First, we list \\nthe match  keyword followed by an expression, which in this case is the value \\ncoin \\uf076. This seems very similar to an expression used with if, but there’s a \\nbig difference: with if, the expression needs to return a Boolean value, but \\nhere, it can be any type. The type of coin in this example is the Coin enum \\nthat we defined at \\uf075 .\\nNext are the match  arms. An arm has two parts: a pattern and some code. \\nThe first arm here has a pattern that is the value Coin::Penny  and then the => \\noperator that separates the pattern and the code to run \\uf077 . The code in this \\ncase is just the value 1. Each arm is separated from the next with a comma.\\nWhen the match  expression executes, it compares the resulting value \\nagainst the pattern of each arm, in order. If a pattern matches the value, the \\ncode associated with that pattern is executed. If that pattern doesn’t match the value, execution continues to the next arm, much as in a coin-sorting machine. We can have as many arms as we need: in Listing 6-3, our \\nmatch  has \\nfour arms.\\nThe code associated with each arm is an expression, and the resulting \\nvalue of the expression in the matching arm is the value that gets returned for the entire \\nmatch  expression.\\nCurly brackets typically aren’t used if the match arm code is short, \\nas it is in Listing 6-3 where each arm just returns a value. If you want to run multiple lines of code in a match arm, you can use curly brackets. For example, the following code would print “Lucky penny!” every time the method was called with a \\nCoin::Penny  but would still return the last value \\nof the block, 1:\\nfn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u32 {\\n    match coin {\\n        Coin::Penny => {\\n            println!(\"Lucky penny!\");\\n            1\\n        },        Coin::Nickel => 5,\\n        Coin::Dime => 10,        Coin::Quarter => 25,\\n    }}\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

This is how we can extract values out of enum variants.\\nAs an example, let’s change one of our enum variants to hold data \\ninside it. From 1999 through 2008, the United States minted quarters with different designs for each of the 50 states on one side. No other coins got state designs, so only quarters have this extra value. We can add this infor -\\nmation to our \\nenum by changing the Quarter  variant to include a UsState  value \\nstored inside it, which we’ve done here in Listing 6-4.\\n#[derive(Debug)] // so we can inspect the state in a minute\\nenum UsState {\\n    Alabama,\\n    Alaska,\\n    // --snip--\\n}\\nenum Coin {\\n    Penny,\\n    Nickel,\\n    Dime,\\n    Quarter(UsState),\\n}\\nListing 6-4: A Coin enum in which the Quarter  variant also holds a UsState  value\\nLet’s imagine that a friend of ours is trying to collect all 50 state quar -\\nters. While we sort our loose change by coin type, we’ll also call out the \\nname of the state associated with each quarter so if it’s one our friend doesn’t have, they can add it to their collection.\\nIn the match expression for this code, we add a variable called \\nstate  \\nto the pattern that matches values of the variant Coin::Quarter . When a \\nCoin::Quarter  matches, the state  variable will bind to the value of that quar -\\nter’s state. Then we can use state  in the code for that arm, like so:\\nfn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u32 {\\n    match coin {\\n        Coin::Penny => 1,\\n        Coin::Nickel => 5,\\n        Coin::Dime => 10,\\n        Coin::Quarter(state) => {            println!(\"State quarter from {:?}!\", state);\\n            25\\n        },\\n    }\\n}\\nIf we were to call value_in_cents(Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska)) , \\ncoin would be Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska) . When we compare that \\nvalue with each of the match arms, none of them match until we reach \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

At that point, the binding for state  will be the value \\nUsState::Alaska . We can then use that binding in the println!  expression, \\nthus getting the inner state value out of the Coin enum variant for Quarter .\\nMatching with Option<T>\\nIn the previous section, we wanted to get the inner T value out of the Some \\ncase when using Option<T> ; we can also handle Option<T>  using match  as we did \\nwith the Coin enum! Instead of comparing coins, we’ll compare the variants \\nof Option<T> , but the way that the match  expression works remains the same.\\nLet’s say we want to write a function that takes an Option<i32>  and, if \\nthere’s a value inside, adds 1 to that value. If there isn’t a value inside, the \\nfunction should return the None value and not attempt to perform any \\noperations.\\nThis function is very easy to write, thanks to match , and will look like \\nListing 6-5.\\nfn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {\\n    match x {\\n        \\uf075 None => None,        \\uf076 Some(i) => Some(i + 1),\\n    }}\\nlet five = Some(5);\\nlet six = plus_one(five);\\uf077\\nlet none = plus_one(None);\\uf078\\nListing 6-5: A function that uses a \\nmatch  expression on an Option<i32>\\nLet’s examine the first execution of plus_one  in more detail. When we \\ncall plus_one(five)  \\uf077, the variable x in the body of plus_one  will have the \\nvalue Some(5) . We then compare that against each match arm.\\nThe Some(5)  value doesn’t match the pattern None \\uf075, so we continue to the \\nnext arm. Does Some(5)  match Some(i)  \\uf076? Why yes it does! We have the same \\nvariant. The i binds to the value contained in Some, so i takes the value  5. The \\ncode in the match arm is then executed, so we add 1 to the value of i and \\ncreate a new Some value with our total 6 inside.\\nNow let’s consider the second call of plus_one  in Listing 6-5, where x is \\nNone \\uf078. We enter the match  and compare to the first arm \\uf075 .\\nIt matches! There’s no value to add to, so the program stops and returns \\nthe None value on the right side of =>. Because the first arm matched, no other \\narms are compared.\\nCombining match  and enums is useful in many situations. You’ll see this \\npattern a lot in Rust code: match against an enum, bind a variable to the data \\ninside, and then execute code based on it.

To satisfy the match  expression, we have \\nto add _ => ()  after processing just one variant, which is a lot of boilerplate \\ncode to add.\\nInstead, we could write this in a shorter way using if let . The following \\ncode behaves the same as the match  in Listing 6-6:\\nif let Some(3) = some_u8_value {\\n    println!(\"three\");\\n}\\nThe syntax if let  takes a pattern and an expression separated by an \\nequal sign. It works the same way as a match , where the expression is given \\nto the match  and the pattern is its first arm.\\nUsing if let  means less typing, less indentation, and less boiler  plate \\ncode. However, you lose the exhaustive checking that match  enforces. \\nChoosing between match  and if let  depends on what you’re doing in your \\nparticular situation and whether gaining conciseness is an appropriate \\ntrade-off for losing exhaustive checking.\\nIn other words, you can think of if let  as syntax sugar for a match  that \\nruns code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other values. \\nWe can include an \\nelse with an if let .

For example, the \\nrand crate discussed in Chapter 2 is a library crate that we used as a depen -\\ndency in the guessing game project.\\nWe’ll create a skeleton of a library that provides some general network -\\ning functionality; we’ll concentrate on the organization of the modules and functions, but we won’t worry about what code goes in the function bodies. We’ll call our library \\ncommunicator . To create a library, pass the --lib  option \\ninstead of --bin :\\n$ cargo new communicator --lib\\n$ cd communicator\\nNotice that Cargo generated src/lib.rs  instead of src/main.rs .

Every module \\ndefinition in Rust starts with the mod keyword. Add this code to the beginning \\nof the src/lib.rs  file, above the test code:\\nmod network {\\n    fn connect() {\\n    }\\n}\\nAfter the mod keyword, we put the name of the module, network , and \\nthen a block of code in curly brackets. Everything inside this block is inside \\nthe namespace network . In this case, we have a single function, connect . If \\nwe wanted to call this function from code outside the network  module, we \\nwould need to specify the module and use the :: namespace syntax like so: \\nnetwork::connect() .\\nWe can also have multiple modules, side by side, in the same src/lib.rs  \\nfile. For example, to also have a client  module that has a function named \\nconnect , we can add it as shown in Listing 7-1.\\nmod network {\\n    fn connect() {\\n    }\\n}\\nmod client {\\n    fn connect() {\\n    }\\n}\\nListing 7-1: The network  module and the client  module defined side by side in src/lib.rs\\nNow we have a network::connect  function and a client::connect  function. \\nThese can have completely different functionality, and the function names \\ndo not conflict with each other because they’re in different modules.\\nIn this case, because we’re building a library, the file that serves as \\nthe entry point for building our library is src/lib.rs . However, in respect \\nto creating modules, there’s nothing special about src/lib.rs . We could \\nalso create modules in src/main.rs  for a binary crate in the same way as \\nwe’re creating modules in src/lib.rs  for the library crate. In fact, we can put \\nmodules inside of modules, which can be useful as your modules grow to keep related functionality organized together and separate functionality apart. The way you choose to organize your code depends on how you think about the relationship between the parts of your code. For instance, the \\nclient  code and its connect  function might make more sense to users of our \\nlibrary if they were inside the network  namespace instead, as in Listing 7-2.src/lib.rs\\nsrc/lib.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Here’s what the \\norganization of our example in Listing 7-1 looks like when thought of as a hierarchy:\\ncommunicator\\n ├── network\\n └── client\\nAnd here’s the hierarchy corresponding to the example in Listing 7-2:\\ncommunicator \\n└── network\\n     └── client\\nThe hierarchy shows that in Listing 7-2, client  is a child of the network  \\nmodule rather than a sibling. More complicated projects can have many \\nmodules, and they’ll need to be organized logically in order for you to keep track of them. What “logically” means in your project is up to you and depends on how you and your library’s users think about your project’s domain. Use the techniques shown here to create side-by-side modules and nested modules in whatever structure you would like.\\nMoving Modules to Other Files\\nModules form a hierarchical structure, much like another structure in computing that you’re used to: filesystems!

If you don’t use a private func -\\ntion within your program, because your program is the only code allowed to use that function, Rust will warn you that the function has gone unused.\\nAfter you specify that a function such as \\nclient::connect  is public, not \\nonly will your call to that function from your binary crate be allowed, but also the warning that the function is unused will go away. Marking a function as public lets Rust know that the function will be used by code outside of your program. Rust considers the theoretical external usage that’s now possible as the function “being used.” Thus, when a function is marked public, Rust will not require that it be used in your program and will stop warning that the function is unused.\\nMaking a Function Public\\nTo tell Rust to make a function public, we add the pub keyword to the \\nstart of the declaration. We’ll focus on fixing the warning that indicates \\nclient::connect  has gone unused for now, as well as the module `client` is \\nprivate  error from our binary crate. Modify src/lib.rs  to make the client  \\nmodule public, like so:\\npub mod client;\\nmod network;\\nThe pub keyword is placed right before mod.

The module named \\noutermost  is private, but the second privacy rule states that the try_me  function \\nis allowed to access the outermost  module because outermost  is in the current \\n(root) module, as is try_me .\\nThe call to outermost::middle_function  will work because middle_function  \\nis public and try_me  is accessing middle_function  through its parent module \\noutermost . We already determined that this module is accessible.\\nThe call to outermost::middle_secret_function  will cause a compilation \\nerror. Because middle_secret_function  is private, the second rule applies. The \\nroot module is neither the current module of middle_secret_function  (outermost  \\nis), nor is it a child module of the current module of middle_secret_function .\\nThe module named inside  is private and has no child modules, so \\nit can be accessed only by its current module outermost . That means the \\ntry_me  function is not allowed to call outermost::inside::inner_function  or \\noutermost::inside::secret_function .\\nFixing the ErrorsHere are some suggestions for changing the code in an attempt to fix the \\nerrors. Make a guess as to whether it will fix the errors before you try each one. Then compile the code to see whether or not you’re right, using the privacy rules to understand why.

Fortunately, Rust has a keyword to make these calls more concise.\\nBringing Names into Scope with the use Keyword\\nRust’s use keyword shortens lengthy function calls by bringing the modules \\nof the function you want to call into scope. Here’s an example of bringing \\nthe a::series::of  module into a binary crate’s root scope:\\npub mod a {\\n    pub mod series {\\n        pub mod of {\\n            pub fn nested_modules() {}\\n        }\\n    }}\\nuse a::series::of;fn main() {\\n    of::nested_modules();\\n}\\nThe line use a::series::of;  means that rather than using the full \\na::series::of  path wherever we want to refer to the of module, we can use of.\\nThe use keyword brings only what we’ve specified into scope; it does \\nnot bring children of modules into scope. That’s why we still have to use \\nof::nested_modules  when we want to call the nested_modules  function.\\nWe could have chosen to bring the function into scope by instead \\nspecifying the function in the use as follows:\\npub mod a {    pub mod series {src/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Let’s go into more detail about that \\nnow. In your communicator  project, open src/lib.rs :\\npub mod client;\\npub mod network;#[cfg(test)]\\nmod tests {    #[test]\\n    fn it_works() {\\n        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);\\n    }\\n}\\nChapter 11 explains more about testing, but parts of this example \\nshould make sense now: we have a module named tests  that lives next to \\nour other modules and contains one function named it_works . Even though \\nthere are special annotations, the tests  module is just another module! So \\nour module hierarchy looks like this:\\ncommunicator \\n├── client\\n ├── network\\n │   └── client\\n └── tests\\nTests are for exercising the code within our library, so let’s try to call \\nour client::connect  function from this it_works  function, even though we \\nwon’t be checking any functionality right now.

We don’t need to place communicator::  \\nin front of the function, as we did in src/main.rs , because we are definitely \\nwithin the communicator  library crate here. The reason is that paths are always \\nrelative to the current module, which here is tests . The only exception is in a \\nuse statement, where paths are relative to the crate root by default. Our tests  \\nmodule needs the client  module in its scope!\\nSo how do we get back up one module in the module hierarchy to call \\nthe client::connect  function in the tests  module? In the tests  module, we \\ncan either use leading colons to let Rust know that we want to start from the \\nroot and list the whole path, like this:\\n::client::connect();\\nOr, we can use super  to move up one module in the hierarchy from our \\ncurrent module, like this:\\nsuper::client::connect();\\nThese two options don’t look that different in this example, but if \\nyou’re deeper in a module hierarchy, starting from the root every time would make your code lengthy. In those cases, using \\nsuper  to get from the \\ncurrent module to sibling modules is a good shortcut. Plus, if you’ve speci -\\nfied the path from the root in many places in your code and then rearrange your modules by moving a subtree to another place, you’ll end up needing to update the path in several places, which would be tedious.\\nIt would also be annoying to have to type \\nsuper::  in each test, but you’ve \\nalready seen the tool for that solution: use! The super::  functionality changes \\nthe path you give to use so it is relative to the parent module instead of to the \\nroot module.\\nFor these reasons, in the tests  module especially, use super::something  is \\nusually the best solution.

Vectors \\nallow you to store more than one value in a single data structure that puts all the values next to each other in memory. Vectors can only store values of the same type. They are useful when you have a list of items, such as the lines of text in a file or the prices of items in a shopping cart.\\nCreating a New Vector\\nTo create a new, empty vector, we can call the Vec::new  function, as shown in \\nListing  8-1.\\nlet v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();\\nListing 8-1: Creating a new, empty vector to hold values of type i32\\nNote that we added a type annotation here. Because we aren’t inserting \\nany values into this vector, Rust doesn’t know what kind of elements we intend \\nto store. This is an important point. Vectors are implemented using generics; we’ll cover how to use generics with your own types in Chapter 10. For now, know that the \\nVec<T>  type provided by the standard library can hold any type, \\nand when a specific vector holds a specific type, the type is specified within angle brackets. In Listing 8-1, we’ve told Rust that the \\nVec<T>  in v will hold \\nelements of the i32 type.\\nIn more realistic code, Rust can often infer the type of value you want to \\nstore once you insert values, so you rarely need to do this type annotation. It’s more common to create a \\nVec<T>  that has initial values, and Rust provides the \\nvec! macro for convenience. The macro will create a new vector that holds the \\nvalues you give it. Listing 8-2 creates a new Vec<i32>  that holds the values 1, 2, \\nand 3. \\nlet v = vec![1, 2, 3];\\nListing 8-2: Creating a new vector containing values\\nBecause we’ve given initial i32 values, Rust can infer that the type of v is \\nVec<i32> , and the type annotation isn’t necessary.

This may seem like a \\nstraightforward point but can get a bit more complicated when you start to introduce references to the elements of the vector. Let’s tackle that next!\\nReading Elements of Vectors\\nNow that you know how to create, update, and destroy vectors, knowing how to read their contents is a good next step. There are two ways to reference a value stored in a vector. In the examples, we’ve annotated the types of the values that are returned from these functions for extra clarity.\\nListing 8-5 shows both methods of accessing a value in a vector, either \\nwith indexing syntax or the \\nget method.\\nlet v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\\nlet third: &i32 = &v[2];\\nlet third: Option<&i32> = v.get(2);\\nListing 8-5: Using indexing syntax or the get method to access an item in a vector\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 161}, page_content=\"132   Chapter 8Note two details here. First, we use the index value of 2 to get the third \\nelement: vectors are indexed by number, starting at zero. Second, the two \\nways to get the third element are by using & and [], which gives us a reference, \\nor by using the get method with the index passed as an argument, which \\ngives us an Option<&T> .\\nRust has two ways to reference an element so you can choose how the \\nprogram behaves when you try to use an index value that the vector doesn’t have an element for. As an example, let’s see what a program will do if it has a vector that holds five elements and then tries to access an element at index 100, as shown in Listing 8-6.\\nlet v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\\nlet does_not_exist = &v[100];\\nlet does_not_exist = v.get(100);\\nListing 8-6: Attempting to access the element at index 100 in a vector containing \\nfive elements\\nWhen we run this code, the first [] method will cause the program to \\npanic because it references a nonexistent element. This method is best used \\nwhen you want your program to crash if there’s an attempt to access an ele -\\nment past the end of the vector.\\nWhen the get method is passed an index that is outside the vector, it \\nreturns None without panicking. You would use this method if accessing an \\nelement beyond the range of the vector happens occasionally under nor -\\nmal circumstances. Your code will then have logic to handle having either \\nSome(&element)  or None, as discussed in Chapter 6. For example, the index \\ncould be coming from a person entering a number. If they accidentally enter a number that’s too large and the program gets a \\nNone value, you \\ncould tell the user how many items are in the current vector and give them another chance to enter a valid value. That would be more user-friendly than crashing the program due to a typo!\\nWhen the program has a valid reference, the borrow checker enforces \\nthe ownership and borrowing rules (covered in Chapter 4) to ensure this reference and any other references to the contents of the vector remain valid. Recall the rule that states you can’t have mutable and immutable ref -\\nerences in the same scope. That rule applies in Listing 8-7, where we hold an immutable reference to the first element in a vector and try to add an element to the end, which won't work.\\nlet mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\\nlet first = &v[0];v.push(6);\\nListing 8-7: Attempting to add an element to a vector while holding a reference to an item\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir\"),\n",

This error is due to the way vectors work: adding a new element onto the end of the vector might require allocating new memory and copying the old elements to the new space, if there isn’t enough room to put all the elements next to each other where the vector currently is. In that case, the reference to the first element would be pointing to deallo -\\ncated memory.

This can be inconvenient; there are definitely use cases for needing to store a list of items of different types. Fortunately, the variants of an enum are defined under the same enum type, so when we need to store elements of a different type in a vector, we can define and use an enum!\\nFor example, say we want to get values from a row in a spreadsheet in \\nwhich some of the columns in the row contain integers, some floating-point numbers, and some strings. We can define an enum whose variants will hold the different value types, and then all the enum variants will be considered the same type: that of the enum. Then we can create a vector that holds that enum and so, ultimately, holds different types. We’ve dem -\\nonstrated this in Listing 8-10.\\nenum SpreadsheetCell {\\n    Int(i32),\\n    Float(f64),\\n    Text(String),\\n}\\nlet row = vec![\\n    SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),\\n    SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from(\"blue\")),\\n    SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),\\n];\\nListing 8-10: Defining an enum to store values of different types in one vector\\nRust needs to know what types will be in the vector at compile time so it \\nknows exactly how much memory on the heap will be needed to store each \\nelement. A secondary advantage is that we can be explicit about what types are allowed in this vector. If Rust allowed a vector to hold any type, there would be a chance that one or more of the types would cause errors with the operations performed on the elements of the vector. Using an enum plus a \\nmatch  expression means that Rust will ensure at compile time that \\nevery possible case is handled, as discussed in Chapter 6. \\nWhen you’re writing a program, if you don’t know the exhaustive set of \\ntypes the program will get at runtime to store in a vector, the enum tech -\\nnique won’t work. Instead, you can use a trait object, which we’ll cover in Chapter 17.\\nNow that we’ve discussed some of the most common ways to use vectors, \\nbe sure to review the API documentation for all the many useful methods defined on \\nVec<T>  by the standard library. For example, in addition to push, a \\npop method removes and returns the last element. Let’s move on to the next \\ncollection type: String !\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

New Rustaceans commonly get stuck on strings for a combination of three reasons: Rust’s propensity for exposing possible errors, strings being a more complicated data structure than many programmers give them credit for, and UTF-8. These factors combine in a way that can seem difficult when you’re coming from other programming languages.\\nIt’s useful to discuss strings in the context of collections because strings \\nare implemented as a collection of bytes, plus some methods to provide use -\\nful functionality when those bytes are interpreted as text. In this section, we’ll talk about the operations on \\nString  that every collection type has, such as \\ncreating, updating, and reading. We’ll also discuss the ways in which String  \\nis different from the other collections, namely how indexing into a String  is \\ncomplicated by the differences between how people and computers interpret \\nString  data.\\nWhat Is a String?\\nWe’ll first define what we mean by the term string . Rust has only one string \\ntype in the core language, which is the string slice str that is usually seen in \\nits borrowed form &str. In Chapter 4, we talked about string slices , which are \\nreferences to some UTF-8 encoded string data stored elsewhere. String lit -\\nerals, for example, are stored in the binary output of the program and are therefore string slices.\\nThe \\nString  type, which is provided by Rust’s standard library rather than \\ncoded into the core language, is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type. When Rustaceans refer to “strings” in Rust, they usually mean the \\nString  and the string slice &str types, not just one of those types. Although \\nthis section is largely about String , both types are used heavily in Rust’s stan -\\ndard library, and both String  and string slices are UTF-8 encoded.\\nRust’s standard library also includes a number of other string types, \\nsuch as OsString , OsStr , CString , and CStr. Library crates can provide even \\nmore options for storing string data. See how those names all end in String  \\nor Str? They refer to owned and borrowed variants, just like the String  and \\nstr types you’ve seen previously. These string types can store text in differ -\\nent encodings or be represented in memory in a different way, for example. We won’t discuss these other string types in this chapter; see their API doc -\\numentation for more about how to use them and when each is appropriate.\\nCreating a New String\\nMany of the same operations available with Vec<T>  are available with \\nString  as well, starting with the new function to create a string, shown in \\nListing  8-11.\\nlet mut s = String::new();\\nListing 8-11: Creating a new, empty String\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Often, we’ll have some initial data that we want to start the string \\nwith. For that, we use the to_string  method, which is available on any type \\nthat implements the Display  trait, as string literals do. Listing 8-12 shows two \\nexamples.\\nlet data = \"initial contents\";\\nlet s = data.to_string();// the method also works on a literal directly:\\nlet s = \"initial contents\".to_string();\\nListing 8-12: Using the \\nto_string  method to create a String  from a string literal\\nThis code creates a string containing initial contents .\\nWe can also use the function String::from  to create a String  from a string \\nliteral. The code in Listing 8-13 is equivalent to the code from Listing 8-12 \\nthat uses to_string .\\nlet s = String::from(\"initial contents\");\\nListing 8-13: Using the String::from  function to create a String  from a string literal\\nBecause strings are used for so many things, we can use many different \\ngeneric APIs for strings, providing us with a lot of options. Some of them \\ncan seem redundant, but they all have their place! In this case, String::from  \\nand to_string  do the same thing, so which you choose is a matter of style.\\nRemember that strings are UTF-8 encoded, so we can include any prop -\\nerly encoded data in them, as shown in Listing 8-14.\\nlet hello = String::from(\"السلام عليكم;)\" \\nlet hello = String::from(\"Dobrý den\");\\nlet hello = String::from(\"Hello\");\\nlet hello = String::from(\"שָׁלוֹם ;)\"\\nlet hello = String::from(\"नमस्ते \");\\nlet hello = String::from(\"こんにちは\");\\nlet hello = String::from(\"안녕하세요\");\\nlet hello = String::from(\"你好\");\\nlet hello = String::from(\"Olá\");\\nlet hello = String::from(\"Здравствуйте \");\\nlet hello = String::from(\"Hola\");\\nListing 8-14: Storing greetings in different languages in strings\\nAll of these are valid String  values.\\nUpdating a String\\nA String  can grow in size and its contents can change, just like the contents \\nof a Vec<T> , if you push more data into it.

The push_str  method takes \\na string slice because we don’t necessarily want to take ownership of the \\nparameter. For example, the code in Listing 8-16 shows that it would be unfortunate if we weren’t able to use \\ns2 after appending its contents to s1.\\nlet mut s1 = String::from(\"foo\");\\nlet s2 = \"bar\";\\ns1.push_str(s2);\\nprintln!(\"s2 is {}\", s2);\\nListing 8-16: Using a string slice after appending its contents to a String\\nIf the push_str  method took ownership of s2, we wouldn’t be able to print \\nits value on the last line.

Macro\\nOften, you’ll want to combine two existing strings. One way is to use the \\n+ operator, as shown in Listing 8-18.\\nlet s1 = String::from(\"Hello, \");\\nlet s2 = String::from(\"world!\");\\nlet s3 = s1 + &s2; // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used\\nListing 8-18: Using the + operator to combine two String  values into a new String  value\\nThe string s3 will contain Hello, world!  as a result of this code. The rea -\\nson s1 is no longer valid after the addition and the reason we used a refer -\\nence to s2 has to do with the signature of the method that gets called when \\nwe use the + operator. The + operator uses the add method, whose signature \\nlooks something like this:\\nfn add(self, s: &str) -> String {\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 167}, page_content='138   Chapter 8This isn’t the exact signature that’s in the standard library: in the \\nstandard library, add is defined using generics. Here, we’re looking at the \\nsignature of add with concrete types substituted for the generic ones, which \\nis what happens when we call this method with String  values. We’ll discuss \\ngenerics in Chapter 10. This signature gives us the clues we need to under -\\nstand the tricky bits of the + operator.\\nFirst, s2 has an &, meaning that we’re adding a reference  of the second \\nstring to the first string because of the s parameter in the add function: we \\ncan only add a &str to a String ; we can’t add two String  values together. But \\nwait—the type of &s2 is &String , not &str, as specified in the second param -\\neter to add. So why does Listing 8-18 compile? \\nThe reason we’re able to use &s2 in the call to add is that the compiler \\ncan coerce  the &String  argument into a &str. When we call the add method, \\nRust uses a deref coercion , which here turns &s2 into &s2[..] . We’ll discuss \\nderef coercion in more depth in Chapter 15. Because add does not take \\nownership of the s parameter, s2 will still be a valid String  after this \\noperation.\\nSecond, we can see in the signature that add takes ownership of self, \\nbecause self does not  have an &. This means s1 in Listing 8-18 will be \\nmoved into the add call and no longer be valid after that. So although let \\ns3 = s1 + &s2;  looks like it will copy both strings and create a new one, this \\nstatement actually takes ownership of s1, appends a copy of the contents \\nof s2, and then returns ownership of the result. In other words, it looks \\nlike it’s making a lot of copies but isn’t; the implementation is more effi -\\ncient than copying.\\nIf we need to concatenate multiple strings, the behavior of the + operator \\ngets unwieldy:\\nlet s1 = String::from(\"tic\");\\nlet s2 = String::from(\"tac\");\\nlet s3 = String::from(\"toe\");\\nlet s = s1 + \"-\" + &s2 + \"-\" + &s3;\\nAt this point, s will be tic-tac-toe . With all of the + and \" characters, it’s \\ndifficult to see what’s going on. For more complicated string combining, we \\ncan use the format!  macro:\\nlet s1 = String::from(\"tic\");\\nlet s2 = String::from(\"tac\");\\nlet s3 = String::from(\"toe\");\\nlet s = format!(\"{}-{}-{}\", s1, s2, s3);\\nThis code also sets s to tic-tac-toe . The format!  macro works in the same \\nway as println! , but instead of printing the output to the screen, it returns a \\nString  with the contents. The version of the code using format!  is much easier \\nto read and doesn’t take ownership of any of its parameters.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

However, if you try to access parts of a \\nString  using indexing syntax in Rust, \\nyou’ll get an error. Consider the invalid code in Listing 8-19.\\nlet s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\\nlet h = s1[0];\\nListing 8-19: Attempting to use indexing syntax with a String\\nThis code will result in the following error:\\nerror[E0277]: the trait bound `std::string::String: std::ops::Index<{integer}>` is not satisfied\\n -->\\n  |\\n3 |     let h = s1[0];\\n  |             ^^^^^ the type `std::string::String` cannot be indexed by `{integer}`\\n  |  = help: the trait `std::ops::Index<{integer}>` is not implemented for `std::string::String`\\nThe error and the note tell the story: Rust strings don’t support index -\\ning. But why not? To answer that question, we need to discuss how Rust \\nstores strings in memory.\\nInternal Representation\\nA String  is a wrapper over a Vec<u8> . Let’s look at some of our properly \\nencoded UTF-8 example strings from Listing 8-14. First, this one:\\nlet len = String::from(\"Hola\").len();\\nIn this case, len will be 4, which means the vector storing the string \\n\"Hola\"  is 4 bytes long. Each of these letters takes 1 byte when encoded in \\nUTF-8. But what about the following line? (Note that this string begins \\nwith the capital Cyrillic letter Ze, not the Arabic number 3.)\\nlet len = String::from(\"Здравствуйте \").len();\\nAsked how long the string is, you might say 12. However, Rust’s answer \\nis 24: that’s the number of bytes it takes to encode \" Здравствуйте \" in UTF-8, \\nbecause each Unicode scalar value takes 2 bytes of storage. Therefore, an index into the string’s bytes will not always correlate to a valid Unicode scalar value. To demonstrate, consider this invalid Rust code: \\nlet hello = \"Здравствуйте \";\\nlet answer = &hello[0];\\nWhat should the value of answer  be? Should it be З, the first letter? \\nWhen encoded in UTF-8, the first byte of З is 208 and the second is 151, \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 169}, page_content='140   Chapter 8so answer  should in fact be 208, but 208 is not a valid character on its own. \\nReturning 208 is likely not what a user would want if they asked for the \\nfirst letter of this string; however, that’s the only data that Rust has at \\nbyte index 0. Users generally don’t want the byte value returned, even if the string contains only Latin letters: if \\n&\"hello\"[0]  were valid code that \\nreturned the byte value, it would return 104, not h. To avoid returning an \\nunexpected value and causing bugs that might not be discovered imme -\\ndiately, Rust doesn’t compile this code at all and prevents misunderstand -\\nings early in the development process.\\nBytes and Scalar Values and Grapheme Clusters! Oh My!\\nAnother point about UTF-8 is that there are actually three relevant ways to \\nlook at strings from Rust’s perspective: as bytes, scalar values, and grapheme clusters (the closest thing to what we would call letters ).\\nIf we look at the Hindi word “ नमस्ते” written in the Devanagari script, \\nit is stored as a vector of \\nu8 values that looks like this:\\n[224, 164, 168, 224, 164, 174, 224, 164, 184, 224, 165, 141, 224, 164, 164, \\n224, 165, 135]\\nThat’s 18 bytes and is how computers ultimately store this data. If we \\nlook at them as Unicode scalar values, which are what Rust’s char type is, \\nthose bytes look like this:\\n[\\'न\\', \\'म\\', \\'स\\', \\'्\\', \\'त\\', \\'े\\']\\nThere are six char values here, but the fourth and sixth are not letters: \\nthey’re diacritics that don’t make sense on their own. Finally, if we look at \\nthem as grapheme clusters, we’d get what a person would call the four letters that make up the Hindi word:\\n[\"न\", \"म\", \"स्\", \"ते\"]\\nRust provides different ways of interpreting the raw string data that \\ncomputers store so that each program can choose the interpretation it needs, no matter what human language the data is in.\\nA final reason Rust doesn’t allow us to index into a \\nString  to get a char -\\nacter is that indexing operations are expected to always take constant time (O(1)). But it isn’t possible to guarantee that performance with a \\nString , \\nbecause Rust would have to walk through the contents from the beginning to the index to determine how many valid characters there were.\\nSlicing Strings\\nIndexing into a string is often a bad idea because it’s not clear what the return type of the string-indexing operation should be: a byte value, a character, a grapheme cluster, or a string slice.

Different programming languages \\nmake different choices about how to present this complexity to the pro -\\ngrammer. Rust has chosen to make the correct handling of String  data the \\ndefault behavior for all Rust programs, which means programmers have to put more thought into handling UTF-8 data up front. This trade-off exposes more of the complexity of strings than is apparent in other pro -\\ngramming languages, but it prevents you from having to handle errors involving non-ASCII characters later in your development life cycle.\\nLet’s switch to something a bit less complex: hash maps!\\nStoring Keys with Associated Values in Hash Maps\\nThe last of our common collections is the hash map . The type HashMap<K, V>  \\nstores a mapping of keys of type K to values of type V. It does this via a hashing \\nfunction , which determines how it places these keys and values into memory. \\nMany programming languages support this kind of data structure, but they often use a different name, such as hash, map, object, hash table, or associa -\\ntive array, just to name a few.\\nHash maps are useful when you want to look up data not by using an \\nindex, as you can with vectors, but by using a key that can be of any type. For example, in a game, you could keep track of each team’s score in a hash map in which each key is a team’s name and the values are each team’s score. Given a team name, you can retrieve its score.\\nWe’ll go over the basic API of hash maps in this section, but many \\nmore goodies are hiding in the functions defined on \\nHashMap<K, V>  by the \\nstandard library. As always, check the standard library documentation for more information.\\nCreating a New Hash Map\\nYou can create an empty hash map with new and add elements with insert . \\nIn Listing 8-20, we’re keeping track of the scores of two teams whose names \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Of our three common collections, this one is the least \\noften used, so it’s not included in the features brought into scope automati -\\ncally in the prelude. Hash maps also have less support from the standard library; there’s no built-in macro to construct them, for example.\\nJust like vectors, hash maps store their data on the heap. This \\nHashMap  \\nhas keys of type String  and values of type i32. Like vectors, hash maps are \\nhomogeneous: all of the keys must have the same type, and all of the values must have the same type.\\nAnother way of constructing a hash map is by using the \\ncollect  method \\non a vector of tuples, where each tuple consists of a key and its value. The \\ncollect  method gathers data into a number of collection types, including \\nHashMap . For example, if we had the team names and initial scores in two sep -\\narate vectors, we could use the zip method to create a vector of tuples where \\n\"Blue\"  is paired with 10, and so forth. Then we could use the collect  method \\nto turn that vector of tuples into a hash map. as shown in Listing 8-21.\\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\\nlet teams  = vec![String::from(\"Blue\"), String::from(\"Yellow\")];\\nlet initial_scores = vec![10, 50];\\nlet scores: HashMap<_, _> = teams.iter().zip(initial_scores.iter()).collect();\\nListing 8-21: Creating a hash map from a list of teams and a list of scores\\nThe type annotation HashMap<_, _>  is needed here because it’s possible \\nto collect  into many different data structures and Rust doesn’t know which \\nyou want unless you specify. For the parameters for the key and value types, \\nhowever, we use underscores, and Rust can infer the types that the hash map contains based on the types of the data in the vectors.\\nHash Maps and Ownership\\nFor types that implement the Copy trait, such as i32, the values are copied \\ninto the hash map. For owned values such as String , the values will be \\nmoved and the hash map will be the owner of those values, as demon -\\nstrated in Listing 8-22.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

We’ll talk more about these issues in “Validating References with Lifetimes” on page 187.\\nAccessing Values in a Hash Map\\nWe can get a value out of the hash map by providing its key to the get \\nmethod, as shown in Listing 8-23.\\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\\nlet mut scores = HashMap::new();scores.insert(String::from(\"Blue\"), 10);\\nscores.insert(String::from(\"Yellow\"), 50);\\nlet team_name = String::from(\"Blue\");\\nlet score = scores.get(&team_name);\\nListing 8-23: Accessing the score for the Blue team stored in the hash map\\nHere, score  will have the value that’s associated with the Blue team, and \\nthe result will be Some(&10) .

You could replace the old value with the new value, completely disregarding the old value.

Let’s look at how to do each of these!\\nOverwriting a Value\\nIf we insert a key and a value into a hash map and then insert that same key \\nwith a different value, the value associated with that key will be replaced.

The original value of 10 has been \\noverwritten.\\nOnly Inserting a Value If the Key Has No Value\\nIt’s common to check whether a particular key has a value and, if it doesn’t, \\ninsert a value for it. Hash maps have a special API for this called entry  that \\ntakes the key you want to check as a parameter. The return value of the entry  \\nmethod is an enum called Entry  that represents a value that might or might \\nnot exist. Let’s say we want to check whether the key for the Yellow team has a value associated with it. If it doesn’t, we want to insert the value \\n50, and the \\nsame for the Blue team. Using the entry  API, the code looks like Listing 8-25.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

This technique is much cleaner than writing the logic ourselves and, in addition, plays more nicely with the borrow checker.\\nRunning the code in Listing 8-25 will print \\n{\"Yellow\": 50, \"Blue\": 10} . \\nThe first call to entry  will insert the key for the Yellow team with the value \\n50 because the Yellow team doesn’t have a value already. The second call to \\nentry  will not change the hash map because the Blue team already has the \\nvalue 10.\\nUpdating a Value Based on the Old Value\\nAnother common use case for hash maps is to look up a key’s value and \\nthen update it based on the old value. For instance, Listing 8-26 shows code that counts how many times each word appears in some text. We use a hash map with the words as keys and increment the value to keep track of how many times we’ve seen that word. If it’s the first time we’ve seen a word, we’ll first insert the value \\n0.\\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\\nlet text = \"hello world wonderful world\";let mut map = HashMap::new();\\nfor word in text.split_whitespace() {\\n    let count = map.entry(word).or_insert(0);\\n    *count += 1;\\n}\\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", map);\\nListing 8-26: Counting occurrences of words using a hash map that stores words and counts\\nThis code will print {\"world\": 2, \"hello\": 1, \"wonderful\": 1} .

The first consonant of each word is moved to the end of the word and “ay” is added, so “first” becomes “irst-fay.” Words that start with a vowel have “hay” added to the end instead (“apple” becomes “apple-hay”). Keep in mind the details about UTF-8 encoding!\\n•\\tUsing a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add employee names to a department in a company. For example, “Add Sally to Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales.” Then let the user retrieve a list of all people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted alphabetically.\\nThe standard library API documentation describes methods that vectors, \\nstrings, and hash maps have that will be helpful for these exercises!\\nWe’re getting into more complex programs in which operations can \\nfail, so, it’s a perfect time to discuss error handling.

Errors are a fact of life in \\nsoftware, so Rust has a number of features \\nfor handling situations in which something goes \\nwrong. In many cases, Rust requires you to acknowl -\\nedge the possibility of an error and take some action \\nbefore your code will compile. This requirement \\nmakes your program more robust by ensuring that \\nyou’ll discover errors and handle them appropriately \\nbefore you’ve deployed your code to production!\\nRust groups errors into two major categories: recoverable  and unrecoverable  \\nerrors. For a recoverable error, such as a file not found error, it’s reasonable \\nto report the problem to the user and retry the operation. Unrecoverable errors are always symptoms of bugs, like trying to access a location beyond the end of an array.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 179}, page_content='150   Chapter 9Most languages don’t distinguish between these two kinds of errors and \\nhandle both in the same way, using mechanisms such as exceptions. Rust \\ndoesn’t have exceptions. Instead, it has the type Result<T, E>  for recoverable \\nerrors and the panic!  macro that stops execution when the program encoun -\\nters an unrecoverable error. This chapter covers calling panic!  first and then \\ntalks about returning Result<T, E>  values. Additionally, we’ll explore consid -\\nerations when deciding whether to try to recover from an error or to stop execution.\\nUnrecoverable Errors with panic!\\nSometimes, bad things happen in your code, and there’s nothing you can do about it. In these cases, Rust has the \\npanic!  macro. When the panic!  \\nmacro executes, your program will print a failure message, unwind and clean up the stack, and then quit. This most commonly occurs when a bug of some kind has been detected and it’s not clear to the programmer how to handle the error.\\nUnwinding t HE  Stack or a borting  \\nin rES pon SE to a panic\\nBy default, when a panic occurs, the program starts unwinding , which means \\nRust walks back up the stack and cleans up the data from each function it \\nencounters. But this walking back and cleanup is a lot of work. The alternative \\nis to immediately abort , which ends the program without cleaning up. Memory \\nthat the program was using will then need to be cleaned up by the operating system. If in your project you need to make the resulting binary as small as \\npossible, you can switch from unwinding to aborting upon a panic by adding \\npanic = \\'abort\\'  to the appropriate [profile]  sections in your Cargo.toml  file. \\nFor example, if you want to abort on panic in release mode, add this:\\n[profile.release]\\npanic = \\'abort\\'\\nLet’s try calling panic!  in a simple program:\\nfn main() {\\n    panic!(\"crash and burn\");\\n}\\nWhen you run the program, you’ll see something like this:\\n$ cargo run\\n   Compiling panic v0.1.0 (file:///projects/panic)\\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.25 secs\\n     Running \\'target/debug/panic\\'src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Backtrace\\nLet’s look at another example to see what it’s like when a panic!  call comes \\nfrom a library because of a bug in our code instead of from our code calling the macro directly.

In \\nthis situation, Rust will panic. Using [] is supposed to return an element, \\nbut if you pass an invalid index, there’s no element that Rust could return here that would be correct.\\nOther languages, like C, will attempt to give you exactly what you asked \\nfor in this situation, even though it isn’t what you want: you’ll get whatever is at the location in memory that would correspond to that element in the vector, even though the memory doesn’t belong to the vector. This is called a buffer overread and can lead to security vulnerabilities if an attacker is able to manipulate the index in such a way as to read data they shouldn’t be allowed to that is stored after the array.\\nTo protect your program from this sort of vulnerability, if you try to \\nread an element at an index that doesn’t exist, Rust will stop execution and refuse to continue.

In Listing 9-1, where we deliberately wrote code that would panic in order to demonstrate how to use backtraces, the way to fix the panic is to not request an element at index 99 from a vector that only contains 3 items. When your code panics in the future, you’ll need to figure out what action the code is taking with what values to cause the panic and what the code should do instead.\\nWe’ll come back to \\npanic!  and when we should and should not use panic!  \\nto handle error conditions in “To panic!  or Not to panic! ” on page 161.

Because Result  has these generic type \\nparameters, we can use the Result  type and the functions that the standard \\nlibrary has defined on it in many different situations where the successful \\nvalue and error value we want to return may differ.\\nLet’s call a function that returns a Result  value because the function \\ncould fail.

If we give \\nf a type annotation that we know is not  a return type of the function and \\nthen try to compile the code, the compiler will tell us that the types don’t \\nmatch.

After the match , we can use the file handle for reading or writing.\\nThe other arm of the match  handles the case where we get an Err value \\nfrom File::open .

The Result<T, E>  type has many helper methods \\ndefined on it to do various tasks. One of those methods, called unwrap , is a \\nshortcut method that is implemented just like the match  expression we wrote \\nin Listing 9-4. If the Result  value is the Ok variant, unwrap  will return the value \\ninside the Ok. If the Result  is the Err variant, unwrap  will call the panic!  macro \\nfor us. Here is an example of unwrap  in action:\\nuse std::fs::File;\\nfn main() {\\n    let f = File::open(\"hello.txt\").unwrap();\\n}\\nIf we run this code without a hello.txt  file, we’ll see an error message \\nfrom the panic!  call that the unwrap  method makes:\\nthread \\'main\\' panicked at \\'called \\'Result::unwrap()\\' on an \\'Err\\' value: Error \\n{ repr: Os { code: 2, message: \"No such file or directory\" } }\\', /src/libcore/\\nresult.rs:906:4\\nAnother method, expect , which is similar to unwrap , lets us also choose \\nthe panic!  error message. Using expect  instead of unwrap  and providing good \\nerror messages can convey your intent and make tracking down the source \\nof a panic easier. The syntax of expect  looks like this:\\nuse std::fs::File;\\nfn main() {\\n    let f = File::open(\"hello.txt\").expect(\"Failed to open hello.txt\");\\n}\\nWe use expect  in the same way as unwrap : to return the file handle or call \\nthe panic!  macro. The error message used by expect  in its call to panic!  will \\nbe the parameter that we pass to expect , rather than the default panic!  mes -\\nsage that unwrap  uses. Here’s what it looks like:\\nthread \\'main\\' panicked at \\'Failed to open hello.txt: Error { repr: Os { code: \\n2, message: \"No such file or directory\" } }\\', /src/libcore/result.rs:906:4\\nBecause this error message starts with the text we specified, Failed to \\nopen hello.txt , it will be easier to find where in the code this error message src/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

If we use unwrap  in multiple places, it can take more time to \\nfigure out exactly which unwrap  is causing the panic because all unwrap  calls \\nthat panic print the same message.\\nPropagating Errors\\nWhen you’re writing a function whose implementation calls something \\nthat might fail, instead of handling the error within this function, you can return the error to the calling code so that it can decide what to do. This is known as propagating  the error and gives more control to the calling code, \\nwhere there might be more information or logic that dictates how the error should be handled than what you have available in the context of your code.\\nFor example, Listing 9-6 shows a function that reads a username from a \\nfile. If the file doesn’t exist or can’t be read, this function will return those errors to the code that called this function.\\nuse std::io;\\nuse std::io::Read;\\nuse std::fs::File;\\nfn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error>u { \\n    v let f = File::open(\"hello.txt\");     w let mut f = match f { \\n        Ok(file) => file, \\n        Err(e) => return Err(e), \\n    }; \\n    x let mut s = String::new(); \\n    y match f.read_to_string(&mut s)z { \\n        Ok(_) => Ok(s){ , \\n        Err(e) => Err(e)| , \\n    } \\n}    \\nListing 9-6: A function that returns errors to the calling code using \\nmatch\\nLook at the return type of the function first: Result<String, io::Error>  u. \\nThis means the function is returning a value of the type Result<T, E>  where \\nthe generic parameter T has been filled in with the concrete type String  \\nand the generic type E has been filled in with the concrete type io::Error . If \\nthis function succeeds without any problems, the code that calls this func -\\ntion will receive an Ok value that holds a String —the username that this \\nfunction read from the file { . If this function encounters any problems, the \\ncode that calls this function will receive an Err value that holds an instance \\nof io::Error  that contains more information about what the problems were. \\nWe chose io::Error  as the return type of this function because that happens \\nto be the type of the error value returned from both of the operations we’re \\ncalling in this function’s body that might fail: the File::open  function and \\nthe read_to_string  method.src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

When the ? operator calls the from \\nfunction, the error type received is converted into the error type defined \\nin the return type of the current function. This is useful when a function returns one error type to represent all the ways a function might fail, even if parts might fail for many different reasons. As long as each error type imple -\\nments the \\nfrom function to define how to convert itself to the returned error \\ntype, the ? operator takes care of the conversion automatically.\\nIn the context of Listing 9-7, the ? at the end of the File::open  call \\nwill return the value inside an Ok to the variable f. If an error occurs, the \\n? operator will return early out of the whole function and give any Err \\nvalue to the calling code. The same thing applies to the ? at the end of the \\nread_to_string  call.\\nThe ? operator eliminates a lot of boilerplate and makes this function’s \\nimplementation simpler. We could even shorten this code further by chain -\\ning method calls immediately after the ?, as shown in Listing 9-8.\\nuse std::io;\\nuse std::io::Read;\\nuse std::fs::File;\\nfn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {\\n    let mut s = String::new();\\n    File::open(\"hello.txt\")?.read_to_string(&mut s)?;    Ok(s)\\n}\\nListing 9-8: Chaining method calls after the \\n? operator\\nWe’ve moved the creation of the new String  in s to the beginning of the \\nfunction; that part hasn’t changed.

When you choose to return a \\nResult  \\nvalue, you give the calling code options rather than making the decision for it. The calling code could choose to attempt to recover in a way that’s appropriate for its situation, or it could decide that an \\nErr value in this case \\nis unrecoverable, so it can call panic!  and turn your recoverable error into \\nan unrecoverable one.

Let’s explore why it’s appropriate to panic in \\nexamples, prototype code, and tests. Then we’ll discuss situations in which \\nthe compiler can’t tell that failure is impossible, but you as a human can. The chapter will conclude with some general guidelines on how to decide whether to panic in library code.\\nExamples, Prototype Code, and Tests\\nWhen you’re writing an example to illustrate some concept, having robust error-handling code in the example as well can make the example less clear. In examples, it’s understood that a call to a method like \\nunwrap  that could \\npanic is meant as a placeholder for the way you’d want your application to handle errors, which can differ based on what the rest of your code is doing.\\nSimilarly, the \\nunwrap  and expect  methods are very handy when proto -\\ntyping, before you’re ready to decide how to handle errors. They leave clear markers in your code for when you’re ready to make your program more robust.\\nIf a method call fails in a test, you’d want the whole test to fail, even if \\nthat method isn’t the functionality under test. Because \\npanic!  is how a test is \\nmarked as a failure, calling unwrap  or expect  is exactly what should happen.\\nCases in Which You Have More Information Than the Compiler\\nIt would also be appropriate to call unwrap  when you have some other logic \\nthat ensures the Result  will have an Ok value, but the logic isn’t something \\nthe compiler understands. You’ll still have a Result  value that you need to \\nhandle: whatever operation you’re calling still has the possibility of failing in general, even though it’s logically impossible in your particular situation. If you can ensure by manually inspecting the code that you’ll never have an \\nErr variant, it’s perfectly acceptable to call unwrap . Here’s an example:\\nuse std::net::IpAddr;\\nlet home: IpAddr = \"127.0.0.1\".parse().unwrap();\\nWe’re creating an IpAddr  instance by parsing a hardcoded string. We \\ncan see that 127.0.0.1  is a valid IP address, so it’s acceptable to use unwrap  \\nhere. However, having a hardcoded, valid string doesn’t change the return \\ntype of the parse  method: we still get a Result  value, and the compiler will \\nstill make us handle the Result  as if the Err variant is a possibility because \\nthe compiler isn’t smart enough to see that this string is always a valid IP address. If the IP address string came from a user rather than being hard -\\ncoded into the program and therefore did  have a possibility of failure, we’d \\ndefinitely want to handle the \\nResult  in a more robust way instead.\\nGuidelines for Error Handling\\nIt’s advisable to have your code panic when it’s possible that your code could end up in a bad state. In this context, a bad state  is when some assumption, \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Similarly, \\npanic!  is often appropriate if you’re calling external code that is out of your \\ncontrol and it returns an invalid state that you have no way of fixing.\\nWhen a bad state is reached, but it’s expected to happen no matter how \\nwell you write your code, it’s still more appropriate to return a Result  than \\nto make a panic!  call. Examples include a parser being given malformed \\ndata or an HTTP request returning a status that indicates you have hit a \\nrate limit. In these cases, you should indicate that failure is an expected possibility by returning a \\nResult  to propagate these bad states upward so the \\ncalling code can decide how to handle the problem. To call panic!  wouldn’t \\nbe the best way to handle these cases.\\nWhen your code performs operations on values, your code should verify \\nthe values are valid first and panic if the values aren’t valid. This is mostly for safety reasons: attempting to operate on invalid data can expose your code to vulnerabilities. This is the main reason the standard library will call \\npanic!  if \\nyou attempt an out-of-bounds memory access: trying to access memory that doesn’t belong to the current data structure is a common security problem. Functions often have contracts : their behavior is only guaranteed if the inputs \\nmeet particular requirements. Panicking when the contract is violated makes sense because a contract violation always indicates a caller-side bug and it’s not a kind of error you want the calling code to have to explicitly handle. In fact, there’s no reasonable way for calling code to recover; the calling pro -\\ngrammers  need to fix the code. Contracts for a function, especially when a \\nviolation will cause a panic, should be explained in the API documentation for the function.\\nHowever, having lots of error checks in all of your functions would be \\nverbose and annoying. Fortunately, you can use Rust’s type system (and thus the type checking the compiler does) to do many of the checks for you. If your function has a particular type as a parameter, you can proceed with your code’s logic knowing that the compiler has already ensured you have a valid value. For example, if you have a type rather than an \\nOption , \\nyour program expects to have something  rather than nothing . Your code then \\ndoesn’t have to handle two cases for the Some and None variants: it will only \\nhave one case for definitely having a value. Code trying to pass nothing to your function won’t even compile, so your function doesn’t have to check for that case at runtime. Another example is using an unsigned integer type such as \\nu32, which ensures the parameter is never negative. \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Recall the guessing game in Chapter 2 in which our code asked the user to guess a number between 1 and 100. We never validated that the user’s guess was between those numbers before checking it against our secret number; we only validated that the guess was positive. In this case, the consequences were not very dire: our output of “Too high” or “Too low” would still be cor -\\nrect. But it would be a useful enhancement to guide the user toward valid guesses and have different behavior when a user guesses a number that’s out of range versus when a user types, for example, letters instead.\\nOne way to do this would be to parse the guess as an \\ni32 instead of only \\na u32 to allow potentially negative numbers, and then add a check for the \\nnumber being in range, like so:\\nloop {\\n    // --snip--\\n    let guess: i32 = match guess.trim().parse() {\\n        Ok(num) => num,\\n        Err(_) => continue,    };\\n    if guess < 1 || guess > 100 {\\n        println!(\"The secret number will be between 1 and 100.\");\\n        continue;\\n    }\\n    match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {\\n    // --snip--\\n}\\nThe if expression checks whether our value is out of range, tells the \\nuser about the problem, and calls continue  to start the next iteration of the \\nloop and ask for another guess. After the if expression, we can proceed with \\nthe comparisons between guess  and the secret number knowing that guess  is \\nbetween 1 and 100.\\nHowever, this is not an ideal solution: if it were absolutely critical that \\nthe program only operated on values between 1 and 100, and it had many \\nfunctions with this requirement, having a check like this in every function would be tedious (and might impact performance).\\nInstead, we can make a new type and put the validations in a function \\nto create an instance of the type rather than repeating the validations every -\\nwhere. That way, it’s safe for functions to use the new type in their signatures and confidently use the values they receive.

How would we eliminate that duplication? Let’s find out!\\nGeneric Data Types\\nWe can use generics to create definitions for items like function signatures or structs, which we can then use with many different concrete data types. Let’s first look at how to define functions, structs, enums, and methods using generics. Then we’ll discuss how generics affect code performance.\\nIn Function Definitions\\nWhen defining a function that uses generics, we place the generics in the signature of the function where we would usually specify the data types of the parameters and return value. Doing so makes our code more flexible and provides more functionality to callers of our function while preventing code duplication.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

First, we declare the name of the type parameter \\ninside angle brackets just after the name of the struct \\uf075 . Then we can use \\nthe generic type in the struct definition where we would otherwise specify concrete data types \\uf076\\uf077 .\\nNote that because we’ve used only one generic type to define \\nPoint<T> , \\nthis definition says that the Point<T>  struct is generic over some type T, and \\nthe fields x and y are both  that same type, whatever that type may be. If \\nwe create an instance of a Point<T>  that has values of different types, as in \\nListing 10-7, our code won’t compile.\\nstruct Point<T> {\\n    x: T,\\n    y: T,\\n}\\nfn main() {\\n    let wont_work = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };\\n}\\nListing 10-7: The fields x and y must be the same type because both have the same \\ngeneric data type T.src/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

For example, \\nin Listing 10-8, we can change the definition of Point  to be generic over \\ntypes T and U where x is of type T and y is of type U.\\nstruct Point<T, U> {\\n    x: T,\\n    y: U,\\n}\\nfn main() {\\n    let both_integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };\\n    let both_float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };\\n    let integer_and_float = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };\\n}\\nListing 10-8: A Point<T, U>  generic over two types so that x and y can be values of \\ndifferent types\\nNow all the instances of Point  shown are allowed! You can use as many \\ngeneric type parameters in a definition as you want, but using more than a \\nfew makes your code hard to read. When you need lots of generic types in your code, it could indicate that your code needs restructuring into smaller pieces.\\nIn Enum Definitions\\nAs we did with structs, we can define enums to hold generic data types in their variants. Let’s take another look at the \\nOption<T>  enum that the stan -\\ndard library provides, which we used in Chapter 6:\\nenum Option<T> {\\n    Some(T),\\n    None,\\n}src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

As you can see, \\nOption<T>  is an enum that is generic over type T and has two variants: Some, \\nwhich holds one value of type T, and a None variant that doesn’t hold any \\nvalue. By using the Option<T>  enum, we can express the abstract concept of \\nhaving an optional value, and because Option<T>  is generic, we can use this \\nabstraction no matter what the type of the optional value is. \\nEnums can use multiple generic types as well. The definition of the \\nResult  enum that we used in Chapter 9 is one example:\\nenum Result<T, E> {\\n    Ok(T),\\n    Err(E),\\n}\\nThe Result  enum is generic over two types, T and E, and has two variants: \\nOk, which holds a value of type T, and Err, which holds a value of type E. This \\ndefinition makes it convenient to use the Result  enum anywhere we have \\nan operation that might succeed (return a value of some type T) or fail \\n(return an error of some type E). In fact, this is what we used to open a file \\nin Listing 9-3 on page 154, where T was filled in with the type std::fs::File  \\nwhen the file was opened successfully and E was filled in with the type \\nstd::io::Error  when there were problems opening the file.\\nWhen you recognize situations in your code with multiple struct or \\nenum definitions that differ only in the types of the values they hold, you \\ncan avoid duplication by using generic types instead.\\nIn Method Definitions\\nWe can implement methods on structs and enums (as we did in Chapter 5) and use generic types in their definitions, too.

By declaring T as a \\ngeneric type after impl, Rust can identify that the type in the angle brackets \\nin Point  is a generic type rather than a concrete type. \\nWe could, for example, implement methods only on Point<f32>  instances \\nrather than on Point<T>  instances with any generic type. In Listing 10-10, we \\nuse the concrete type f32, meaning we don’t declare any types after impl.\\nimpl Point<f32> {\\n    fn distance_from_origin(&self) -> f32 {\\n        (self.x.powi(2) + self.y.powi(2)).sqrt()\\n    }\\n}\\nListing 10-10: An impl block that only applies to a struct with a particular concrete type \\nfor the generic type parameter T\\nThis code means the type Point<f32>  will have a method named \\ndistance_from_origin  and other instances of Point<T>  where T is not of type \\nf32 will not have this method defined.

For example, Listing 10-11 defines the method \\nmixup  on the Point<T, U>  struct from Listing 10-8. The \\nmethod takes another Point  as a parameter, which might have different \\ntypes than the self Point  we’re calling mixup  on.

Calling mixup  \\non p1 with the argument p2 gives us p3 \\uf079, which will have an i32 for x, because \\nx came from p1. The p3 variable will have a char for y, because y came from p2. \\nThe println!  macro call z  will print p3.x = 5, p3.y = c .\\nThe purpose of this example is to demonstrate a situation in which some \\ngeneric parameters are declared with impl and some are declared with the \\nmethod definition. Here, the generic parameters T and U are declared after \\nimpl \\uf075, because they go with the struct definition. The generic parameters \\nV and W are declared after fn mixup  \\uf076, because they’re only relevant to the \\nmethod.\\nPerformance of Code Using Generics\\nYou might be wondering whether there is a runtime cost when you’re using \\ngeneric type parameters. The good news is that Rust implements generics in such a way that your code doesn’t run any slower using generic types than it would with concrete types.\\nRust accomplishes this by performing monomorphization of the code \\nthat is using generics at compile time. Monomorphization  is the process of \\nturning generic code into specific code by filling in the concrete types that are used when compiled.\\nIn this process, the compiler does the opposite of the steps we used to \\ncreate the generic function in Listing 10-5: the compiler looks at all the places where generic code is called and generates code for the concrete types the generic code is called with.\\nLet’s look at how this works with an example that uses the standard \\nlibrary’s \\nOption<T>  enum:\\nlet integer = Some(5);\\nlet float = Some(5.0);\\nWhen Rust compiles this code, it performs monomorphization. During \\nthat process, the compiler reads the values that have been used in Option<T>  \\ninstances and identifies two kinds of Option<T> : one is i32 and the other is f64. \\nAs such, it expands the generic definition of Option<T>  into Option_i32  and \\nOption_f64 , thereby replacing the generic definition with the specific ones.\\nThe monomorphized version of the code looks like the following. The \\ngeneric Option<T>  is replaced with the specific definitions created by the \\ncompiler:\\nenum Option_i32 {    Some(i32),\\n    None,\\n}src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

When the code \\nruns, it performs just as it would if we had duplicated each definition by hand. The process of monomorphization makes Rust’s generics extremely efficient at runtime.\\nTraits: Defining Shared Behavior\\nA trait  tells the Rust compiler about functionality a particular type has and \\ncan share with other types. We can use traits to define shared behavior in an abstract way. We can use trait bounds to specify that a generic can be any type that has certain behavior.\\nno Te Traits are similar to a feature often called interfaces  in other languages, although \\nwith some differences.\\nDefining a Trait\\nA type’s behavior consists of the methods we can call on that type. Different types share the same behavior if we can call the same methods on all of those types. Trait definitions are a way to group method signatures together to define a set of behaviors necessary to accomplish some purpose.\\nFor example, let’s say we have multiple structs that hold various kinds \\nand amounts of text: a \\nNewsArticle  struct that holds a news story filed in a \\nparticular location and a Tweet  that can have at most 280 characters along \\nwith metadata that indicates whether it was a new tweet, a retweet, or a reply to another tweet.\\nWe want to make a media aggregator library that can display summaries \\nof data that might be stored in a \\nNewsArticle  or Tweet  instance. To do this, we \\nneed a summary from each type, and we need to request that summary by calling a \\nsummarize  method on an instance. Listing 10-12 shows the definition \\nof a Summary  trait that expresses this behavior.\\npub trait Summary {\\n    fn summarize(&self) -> String;\\n}\\nListing 10-12: A Summary  trait that consists of the behavior provided by a summarize  methodsrc/lib.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The Summary  trait would also need to be a public trait for \\nanother crate to implement it, which it is because we put the pub keyword \\nbefore trait  in Listing 10-12.\\nOne restriction to note with trait implementations is that we can \\nimplement a trait on a type only if either the trait or the type is local to our crate. For example, we can implement standard library traits like \\nDisplay  on a custom type like Tweet  as part of our aggregator  crate func -\\ntionality, because the type Tweet  is local to our aggregator  crate. We can \\nalso implement Summary  on Vec<T>  in our aggregator  crate, because the trait \\nSummary  is local to our aggregator  crate.\\nBut we can’t implement external traits on external types.

As a result, we can still \\ncall the summarize  method on an instance of NewsArticle , like this:\\nlet article = NewsArticle {\\n    headline: String::from(\"Penguins win the Stanley Cup Championship!\"),\\n    location: String::from(\"Pittsburgh, PA, USA\"),\\n    author: String::from(\"Iceburgh\"),\\n    content: String::from(\"The Pittsburgh Penguins once again are the best\\n    hockey team in the NHL.\"),};\\nprintln!(\"New article available! {}\", article.summarize());\\nThis code prints New article available! (Read more...) .\\nCreating a default implementation for summarize  doesn’t require us to \\nchange anything about the implementation of Summary  on Tweet  in Listing  10-13. \\nThe reason is that the syntax for overriding a default implementation is \\nthe same as the syntax for implementing a trait method that doesn’t have a default implementation.\\nDefault implementations can call other methods in the same trait, even \\nif those other methods don’t have a default implementation. In this way, a trait can provide a lot of useful functionality and only require implemen -\\ntors to specify a small part of it.

We can use trait bounds to constrain generic types to ensure the type will be limited to those that implement a particular trait and behavior.\\nFor example, in Listing 10-13, we implemented the \\nSummary  trait on the \\ntypes NewsArticle  and Tweet . We can define a function notify  that calls the \\nsummarize  method on its parameter item, which is of the generic type T.

Because of the trait bound on T, \\nwe can call notify  and pass in any instance of NewsArticle  or Tweet . Code that \\ncalls the function with any other type, like a String  or an i32, won’t compile, \\nbecause those types don’t implement Summary .\\nWe can specify multiple trait bounds on a generic type using the + syntax. \\nFor example, to use display formatting on the type T in a function as well as \\nthe summarize  method, we can use T: Summary + Display  to say T can be any type \\nthat implements Summary  and Display .\\nHowever, there are downsides to using too many trait bounds. Each \\ngeneric has its own trait bounds, so functions with multiple generic type \\nparameters can have lots of trait bound information between a function’s name and its parameter list, making the function signature hard to read. For this reason, Rust has alternate syntax for specifying trait bounds inside a \\nwhere  clause after the function signature. So instead of writing this:\\nfn some_function<T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug>(t: T, u: U) -> i32 {\\nwe can use a where  clause, like this:\\nfn some_function<T, U>(t: T, u: U) -> i32\\n    where T: Display + Clone,\\n          U: Clone + Debug\\n{\\nThis function’s signature is less cluttered in that the function name, \\nparameter list, and return type are close together, similar to a function \\nwithout lots of trait bounds.\\nFixing the largest Function with Trait Bounds\\nNow that you know how to specify the behavior you want to use using the generic type parameter’s bounds, let’s return to Listing 10-5 to fix the defi -\\nnition of the \\nlargest  function that uses a generic type parameter!

As discussed in “Stack-Only Data: Copy” on \\npage 65, types like i32 and char that have a known size can be stored on the \\nstack, so they implement the Copy trait.

Then we could clone each value in the slice when we want the largest  \\nfunction to have ownership. Using the clone  function means we’re potentially \\nmaking more heap allocations in the case of types that own heap data like \\nString , and heap allocations can be slow if we’re working with large amounts \\nof data.\\nAnother way we could implement largest  is for the function to return a \\nreference to a T value in the slice.

Try implementing these alternate solutions on your own!\\nUsing Trait Bounds to Conditionally Implement Methods\\nBy using a trait bound with an impl block that uses generic type parameters, \\nwe can implement methods conditionally for types that implement the spec -\\nified traits. For example, the type Pair<T>  in Listing 10-16 always implements \\nthe new function. But Pair<T>  only implements the cmp_display  method if its \\ninner type T implements the PartialOrd  trait that enables comparison and  \\nthe Display  trait that enables printing.\\nuse std::fmt::Display;\\nstruct Pair<T> {\\n    x: T,\\n    y: T,\\n}\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Implementations of a trait on any type that satisfies the trait \\nbounds are called blanket implementations  and are extensively used in the Rust \\nstandard library. For example, the standard library implements the ToString  \\ntrait on any type that implements the Display  trait. The impl block in the stan -\\ndard library looks similar to this code:\\nimpl<T: Display> ToString for T {\\n    // --snip--\\n}\\nBecause the standard library has this blanket implementation, we can \\ncall the to_string  method defined by the ToString  trait on any type that \\nimplements the Display  trait. For example, we can turn integers into their \\ncorresponding String  values like this because integers implement Display :\\nlet s = 3.to_string();\\nBlanket implementations appear in the documentation for the trait in \\nthe “Implementors” section.\\nTraits and trait bounds let us write code that uses generic type param -\\neters to reduce duplication but also specify to the compiler that we want the \\ngeneric type to have particular behavior. The compiler can then use the trait bound information to check that all the concrete types used with our code provide the correct behavior. In dynamically typed languages, we would get an error at runtime if we called a method on a type that the type didn’t implement. But Rust moves these errors to compile time so we’re forced to fix the problems before our code is even able to run. Additionally, we don’t \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Doing so improves performance without having to give up the flexibility of generics.\\nAnother kind of generic that we’ve already been using is called lifetimes . \\nRather than ensuring that a type has the behavior we want, lifetimes ensure that references are valid as long as we need them to be. Let’s look at how lifetimes do that.\\nValidating References with Lifetimes\\nOne detail we didn’t discuss in “References and Borrowing” on page 68 is that every reference in Rust has a lifetime , which is the scope for which that \\nreference is valid. Most of the time, lifetimes are implicit and inferred, just like most of the time, types are inferred. We must annotate types when multiple types are possible. In a similar way, we must annotate lifetimes when the lifetimes of references could be related in a few different ways. Rust requires us to annotate the relationships using generic lifetime param -\\neters to ensure the actual references used at runtime will definitely be valid.\\nThe concept of lifetimes is somewhat different from tools in other pro -\\ngramming languages, arguably making lifetimes Rust’s most distinctive feature. Although we won’t cover lifetimes in their entirety in this chapter, we’ll discuss common ways you might encounter lifetime syntax so you can become familiar with the concepts. See “Advanced Lifetimes” on page 423 for more detailed information.\\nPreventing Dangling References with Lifetimes\\nThe main aim of lifetimes is to prevent dangling references, which cause a program to reference data other than the data it’s intended to reference. Consider the program in Listing 10-17, which has an outer scope and an inner scope.\\n{\\n    \\uf075 let r;\\n    {\\n        \\uf076 let x = 5;\\n        \\uf077 r = &x;    \\uf078 }\\n    \\uf079 println!(\"r: {}\", r);\\n}\\nListing 10-17: An attempt to use a reference whose value has gone out of scope\\nno Te The examples in Listings 10-17, 10-18, and 10-24 declare variables without giving \\nthem an initial value, so the variable name exists in the outer scope. At first glance, this might appear to be in conflict with Rust’s having no null values. However, if we try to use a variable before giving it a value, we’ll get a compile-time error, which shows that Rust indeed does not allow null values.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

But r is still valid for \\nthe outer scope; because its scope is larger, we say that it “lives longer.” If \\nRust allowed this code to work, r would be referencing memory that was \\ndeallocated when x went out of scope, and anything we tried to do with \\nr wouldn’t work correctly. So how does Rust determine that this code is \\ninvalid? It uses a borrow checker.\\nThe Borrow Checker\\nThe Rust compiler has a borrow checker  that compares scopes to determine \\nwhether all borrows are valid.

Actually, we don’t know either, because the if block in the \\nbody of this function returns a reference to x and the else block returns a \\nreference to y!\\nWhen we’re defining this function, we don’t know the concrete values \\nthat will be passed into this function, so we don’t know whether the if case \\nor the else case will execute. We also don’t know the concrete lifetimes of \\nthe references that will be passed in, so we can’t look at the scopes as we did in Listings 10-18 and 10-19 to determine whether the reference we return will always be valid. The borrow checker can’t determine this either, because it doesn’t know how the lifetimes of \\nx and y relate to the lifetime of the return \\nvalue. To fix this error, we’ll add generic lifetime parameters that define the relationship between the references so the borrow checker can perform its analysis.\\nLifetime Annotation Syntax\\nLifetime annotations don’t change how long any of the references live. Just as functions can accept any type when the signature specifies a generic type parameter, functions can accept references with any lifetime by specifying a generic lifetime parameter. Lifetime annotations describe the relationships of the lifetimes of multiple references to each other without affecting the lifetimes.\\nLifetime annotations have a slightly unusual syntax: the names of \\nlifetime parameters must start with a single quote (\\n') and are usually all \\nlowercase and very short, like generic types. Most people use the name 'a. \\nWe place lifetime parameter annotations after the & of a reference, using a \\nspace to separate the annotation from the reference’s type.\\nHere are some examples: a reference to an i32 without a lifetime \\nparameter, a reference to an i32 that has a lifetime parameter named 'a, \\nand a mutable reference to an i32 that also has the lifetime 'a.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir\"),\n",

For example, let’s say we have a function with the parameter \\nfirst  that is a reference to an i32 with lifetime \\n'a. The function also has another parameter named second  that is another \\nreference to an i32 that also has the lifetime 'a. The lifetime annotations \\nindicate that the references first  and second  must both live as long as that \\ngeneric lifetime.\\nLifetime Annotations in Function Signatures\\nNow let’s examine lifetime annotations in the context of the longest  function. \\nAs with generic type parameters, we need to declare generic lifetime param -\\neters inside angle brackets between the function name and the parameter list. The constraint we want to express in this signature is that all the refer -\\nences in the parameters and the return value must have the same lifetime. We’ll name the lifetime \\n'a and then add it to each reference, as shown in \\nListing  10-22.\\nfn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {\\n    if x.len() > y.len() {\\n        x\\n    } else {\\n        y\\n    }}\\nListing 10-22: The \\nlongest  function definition specifying that all the references in the \\nsignature must have the same lifetime 'a\\nThis code should compile and produce the result we want when we use \\nit with the main function in Listing 10-20.\\nThe function signature now tells Rust that for some lifetime 'a, the \\nfunction takes two parameters, both of which are string slices that live at \\nleast as long as lifetime 'a. The function signature also tells Rust that the \\nstring slice returned from the function will live at least as long as lifetime \\n'a. These constraints are what we want Rust to enforce. Remember, when we \\nspecify the lifetime parameters in this function signature, we’re not chang -\\ning the lifetimes of any values passed in or returned. Rather, we’re speci -\\nfying that the borrow checker should reject any values that don’t adhere to these constraints. Note that the \\nlongest  function doesn’t need to know \\nexactly how long x and y will live, only that some scope can be substituted \\nfor 'a that will satisfy this signature.\\nWhen annotating lifetimes in functions, the annotations go in the func -\\ntion signature, not in the function body. Rust can analyze the code within the function without any help. However, when a function has references to src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir\"),\n",

The lifetimes might be different each time the function is called. This is why we need to annotate the lifetimes manually.\\nWhen we pass concrete references to \\nlongest , the concrete lifetime that is \\nsubstituted for \\'a is the part of the scope of x that overlaps with the scope of \\ny. In other words, the generic lifetime \\'a will get the concrete lifetime that is \\nequal to the smaller of the lifetimes of x and y. Because we’ve annotated the \\nreturned reference with the same lifetime parameter \\'a, the returned refer -\\nence will also be valid for the length of the smaller of the lifetimes of x and y.\\nLet’s look at how the lifetime annotations restrict the longest  function \\nby passing in references that have different concrete lifetimes. Listing 10-23 is a straightforward example.\\nfn main() {\\n    let string1 = String::from(\"long string is long\");\\n    {\\n        let string2 = String::from(\"xyz\");\\n        let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());        println!(\"The longest string is {}\", result);\\n    }\\n}\\nListing 10-23: Using the \\nlongest  function with references to String  values that have different \\nconcrete lifetimes\\nIn this example, string1  is valid until the end of the outer scope, string2  \\nis valid until the end of the inner scope, and result  references something \\nthat is valid until the end of the inner scope. Run this code, and you’ll see that \\nthe borrow checker approves of this code; it will compile and print The longest \\nstring is long string is long .\\nNext, let’s try an example that shows that the lifetime of the reference \\nin result  must be the smaller lifetime of the two arguments. We’ll move \\nthe declaration of the result  variable outside the inner scope but leave the \\nassignment of the value to the result  variable inside the scope with string2 . \\nThen we’ll move the println!  that uses result  outside the inner scope, after \\nthe inner scope has ended. The code in Listing 10-24 will not compile.\\nfn main() {\\n    let string1 = String::from(\"long string is long\");\\n    let result;\\n    {\\n        let string2 = String::from(\"xyz\");\\n        result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());    }\\n    println!(\"The longest string is {}\", result);\\n}\\nListing 10-24: Attempting to use \\nresult  after string2  has gone out of scopesrc/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Rust knows \\nthis because we annotated the lifetimes of the function parameters and \\nreturn values using the same lifetime parameter \\'a.\\nAs humans, we can look at this code and see that string1  is longer than \\nstring2  and therefore result  will contain a reference to string1 . Because \\nstring1  has not gone out of scope yet, a reference to string1  will still be valid \\nfor the println!  statement. However, the compiler can’t see that the refer -\\nence is valid in this case. We’ve told Rust that the lifetime of the reference returned by the \\nlongest  function is the same as the smaller of the lifetimes \\nof the references passed in. Therefore, the borrow checker disallows the code in Listing 10-24 as possibly having an invalid reference.\\nTry designing more experiments that vary the values and lifetimes of the \\nreferences passed in to the \\nlongest  function and how the returned reference \\nis used. Make hypotheses about whether or not your experiments will pass the borrow checker before you compile; then check to see if you’re right!\\nThinking in Terms of Lifetimes\\nThe way in which you need to specify lifetime parameters depends on what your function is doing. For example, if we changed the implementation of the \\nlongest  function to always return the first parameter rather than the \\nlongest string slice, we wouldn’t need to specify a lifetime on the y param -\\neter. The following code will compile:\\nfn longest<\\'a>(x: &\\'a str, y: &str) -> &\\'a str {\\n    x\\n}\\nIn this example, we’ve specified a lifetime parameter \\'a for the param -\\neter x and the return type, but not for the parameter y, because the lifetime \\nof y does not have any relationship with the lifetime of x or the return value.\\nWhen returning a reference from a function, the lifetime parameter for \\nthe return type needs to match the lifetime parameter for one of the param -\\neters. If the reference returned does not  refer to one of the parameters, it \\nmust refer to a value created within this function, which would be a dangling src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

We’re also trying to return a reference to result  \\nfrom the function. There is no way we can specify lifetime parameters that \\nwould change the dangling reference, and Rust won’t let us create a dangling reference. In this case, the best fix would be to return an owned data type rather than a reference so the calling function is then responsible for clean -\\ning up the value.\\nUltimately, lifetime syntax is about connecting the lifetimes of various \\nparameters and return values of functions. Once they’re connected, Rust has enough information to allow memory-safe operations and disallow opera -\\ntions that would create dangling pointers or otherwise violate memory safety.\\nLifetime Annotations in Struct Definitions\\nSo far, we’ve only defined structs to hold owned types. It’s possible for structs to hold references, but in that case we would need to add a lifetime annota -\\ntion on every reference in the struct’s definition.

The data in novel  exists before the ImportantExcerpt  \\ninstance is created. In addition, novel  doesn’t go out of scope until after the \\nImportantExcerpt  goes out of scope, so the reference in the ImportantExcerpt  \\ninstance is valid.\\nLifetime Elision\\nYou’ve learned that every reference has a lifetime and that you need to specify lifetime parameters for functions or structs that use references. However, we had a function in Listing 4-9 on page 78, which is shown again in Listing 10-26, that compiled without lifetime annotations.\\nfn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {\\n    let bytes = s.as_bytes();\\n    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {\\n        if item == b\\' \\' {\\n            return &s[0..i];        }\\n    }\\n    &s[..]\\n}\\nListing 10-26: A function we defined in Listing 4-9 that compiled without lifetime annota -\\ntions, even though the parameter and return type are referencessrc/main.rs\\nsrc/lib.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

At that time, the func -\\ntion signature would have been written like this:\\nfn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {\\nAfter writing a lot of Rust code, the Rust team found that Rust program -\\nmers were entering the same lifetime annotations over and over in particular situations. These situations were predictable and followed a few deterministic patterns. The developers programmed these patterns into the compiler’s code so the borrow checker could infer the lifetimes in these situations and wouldn’t need explicit annotations.\\nThis piece of Rust history is relevant because it’s possible that more \\ndeterministic patterns will emerge and be added to the compiler. In the future, even fewer lifetime annotations might be required.\\nThe patterns programmed into Rust’s analysis of references are called \\nthe lifetime elision rules . These aren’t rules for programmers to follow; they’re \\na set of particular cases that the compiler will consider, and if your code fits these cases, you don’t need to write the lifetimes explicitly.\\nThe elision rules don’t provide full inference. If Rust deterministically \\napplies the rules but there is still ambiguity as to what lifetimes the references have, the compiler won’t guess what the lifetime of the remaining references should be. In this case, instead of guessing, the compiler will give you an error that you can resolve by adding the lifetime annotations that specify how the references relate to each other.\\nLifetimes on function or method parameters are called input lifetimes , \\nand lifetimes on return values are called output lifetimes .\\nThe compiler uses three rules to figure out what lifetimes references \\nhave when there aren’t explicit annotations. The first rule applies to input lifetimes, and the second and third rules apply to output lifetimes. If the compiler gets to the end of the three rules and there are still references for which it can’t figure out lifetimes, the compiler will stop with an error.\\nThe first rule is that each parameter that is a reference gets its own life -\\ntime parameter. In other words, a function with one parameter gets one lifetime parameter: \\nfn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) ; a function with two parameters \\ngets two separate lifetime parameters: fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32) ; \\nand so on.\\nThe second rule is if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that \\nlifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters: fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) \\n-> &'a i32 .\\nThe third rule is if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one \\nof them is &self  or &mut self  because this is a method, the lifetime of self is \\nassigned to all output lifetime parameters.

The third rule doesn’t apply either, because longest  \\nis a function rather than a method, so none of the parameters are self.

In addition, the lifetime elision rules often make it so that lifetime annota -\\ntions aren’t necessary in method signatures.

Therefore, the lifetime of all string literals is \\'static .\\nYou might see suggestions to use the \\'static  lifetime in error messages. \\nBut before specifying \\'static  as the lifetime for a reference, think about \\nwhether the reference you have actually lives the entire lifetime of your pro -\\ngram or not.

In such cases, the solution is fixing those problems, not specifying the \\n\\'static  lifetime.\\nGeneric Type Parameters, Trait Bounds, and Lifetimes Together\\nLet’s briefly look at the syntax of specifying generic type parameters, trait bounds, and lifetimes all in one function!\\nuse std::fmt::Display;\\nfn longest_with_an_announcement<\\'a, T>(x: &\\'a str, y: &\\'a str, ann: T) -> &\\'a \\nstr\\n    where T: Display\\n{    println!(\"Announcement! {}\", ann);\\n    if x.len() > y.len() {\\n        x\\n    } else {\\n        y\\n    }\\n}\\nThis is the longest  function from Listing 10-22 that returns the longer of \\ntwo string slices. But now it has an extra parameter named ann of the generic \\ntype T, which can be filled in by any type that implements the Display  trait as \\nspecified by the where  clause. This extra parameter will be printed before the \\nfunction compares the lengths of the string slices, which is why the Display  \\ntrait bound is necessary. Because lifetimes are a type of generic, the declara -\\ntions of the lifetime parameter \\'a and the generic type parameter T go in the \\nsame list inside the angle brackets after the function name.\\nSummary\\nWe covered a lot in this chapter! Now that you know about generic type \\nparameters, traits and trait bounds, and generic lifetime parameters, you’re ready to write code without repetition that works in many different situa -\\ntions. Generic type parameters let you apply the code to different types. Traits and trait bounds ensure that even though the types are generic, they’ll have the behavior the code needs. You learned how to use lifetime annotations to ensure that this flexible code won’t have any dangling refer -\\nences. And all of this analysis happens at compile time, which doesn’t affect runtime performance!\\nBelieve it or not, there is much more to learn on the topics we discussed \\nin this chapter: Chapter 17 discusses trait objects, which are another way to use traits. Chapter 19 covers more complex scenarios involving lifetime annotations as well as some advanced type system features.

We can run these tests whenever \\nwe make changes to our code to make sure any existing correct behavior has not changed.\\nTesting is a complex skill: although we can’t cover every detail about how \\nto write good tests in one chapter, we’ll discuss the mechanics of Rust’s test \\xad\\ning facilities.

The bodies of test functions typically perform these three actions:\\n1. Set up any needed data or state.\\n2. Run the code you want to test.\\n3. Assert the results are what you expect.Let’s look at the features Rust provides specifically for writing tests that \\ntake these actions, which include the \\ntest attribute, a few macros, and the \\nshould_panic  attribute.\\nThe Anatomy of a Test Function\\nAt its simplest, a test in Rust is a function that’s annotated with the test \\nattribute. Attributes are metadata about pieces of Rust code; one example \\nis the derive  attribute we used with structs in Chapter 5. To change a func \\xad\\ntion into a test function, add #[test]  on the line before fn. When you run \\nyour tests with the cargo test  command, Rust builds a test runner binary \\nthat runs the functions annotated with the test attribute and reports on \\nwhether each test function passes or fails. \\nIn Chapter 7, we saw that when we make a new library project with \\nCargo, a test module with a test function in it is automatically generated for us. This module helps you start writing your tests so you don’t have to look up the exact structure and syntax of test functions every time you start a new project. You can add as many additional test functions and as many test modules as you want!\\nWe’ll explore some aspects of how tests work by experimenting with the \\ntemplate test generated for us without actually testing any code.

Macro\\nThe assert!  macro, provided by the standard library, is useful when you want \\nto ensure that some condition in a test evaluates to true. We give the assert!  \\nmacro an argument that evaluates to a Boolean. If the value is true, assert!  \\ndoes nothing and the test passes. If the value is false , the assert!  macro calls \\nthe panic!  macro, which causes the test to fail. Using the assert!  macro helps \\nus check that our code is functioning in the way we intend. \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Macros\\nA common way to test functionality is to compare the result of the code \\nunder test to the value you expect the code to return to make sure they’re equal. You could do this using the \\nassert!  macro and passing it an expression \\nusing the == operator. However, this is such a common test that the standard \\nlibrary provides a pair of macros— assert_eq!  and assert_ne! —to perform this \\ntest more conveniently. These macros compare two arguments for equality or inequality, respectively. They’ll also print the two values if the assertion fails, which makes it easier to see why  the test failed; conversely, the \\nassert!  macro \\nonly indicates that it got a false  value for the == expression, not the values that \\nlead to the false  value.\\nIn Listing 11 \\xad7, we write a function named add_two  that adds 2 to its \\nparameter and returns the result.

This macro is most useful for cases when we’re not \\nsure what a value will  be, but we know what the value definitely won’t  be if our \\ncode is functioning as we intend. For example, if we’re testing a function that is guaranteed to change its input in some way, but the way in which the input is changed depends on the day of the week that we run our tests, the best thing to assert might be that the output of the function is not equal to the input.\\nUnder the surface, the \\nassert_eq!  and assert_ne!  macros use the operators \\n== and !=, respectively. When the assertions fail, these macros print their argu \\xad\\nments using debug formatting, which means the values being compared must implement the \\nPartialEq  and Debug  traits. All the primitive types and most of \\nthe standard library types implement these traits. For structs and enums that you define, you’ll need to implement \\nPartialEq  to assert that values of those \\ntypes are equal or not equal. You’ll need to implement Debug  to print the values \\nwhen the assertion fails. Because both traits are derivable traits, as mentioned in Listing 5 \\xad12 on page 89, this is usually as straightforward as adding the \\n#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]  annotation to your struct or enum definition. See \\nAppendix C for more details about these and other derivable traits.\\nAdding Custom Failure Messages\\nYou can also add a custom message to be printed with the failure message as optional arguments to the \\nassert! , assert_eq! , and assert_ne!  macros. \\nAny arguments specified after the one required argument to assert!  or \\nthe two required arguments to assert_eq!  and assert_ne!  are passed along \\nto the format!  macro (discussed in “Concatenation with the + Operator \\nor the format!  Macro” on page 137), so you can pass a format string that \\ncontains {} placeholders and values to go in those placeholders. Custom \\nmessages are useful to document what an assertion means; when a test fails, you’ll have a better idea of what the problem is with the code.\\nFor example, let’s say we have a function that greets people by name and \\nwe want to test that the name we pass into the function appears in the output:\\npub fn greeting(name: &str) -> String {\\n    format!(\"Hello {}!\", name)\\n}\\n#[cfg(test)]\\nmod tests {    use super::*;\\n    #[test]\\n    fn greeting_contains_name() {\\n        let result = greeting(\"Carol\");\\n        assert!(result.contains(\"Carol\"));\\n    }}\\nThe requirements for this program haven’t been agreed upon yet, and \\nwe’re pretty sure the Hello  text at the beginning of the greeting will change. src/lib.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

For example, consider the \\nGuess  type that we created in Listing 9 \\xad9 \\non page 165. Other code that uses Guess  depends on the guarantee that \\nGuess  instances will contain only values between 1 and 100. We can write a \\ntest that ensures that attempting to create a Guess  instance with a value out \\xad\\nside that range panics.\\nWe do this by adding another attribute, should_panic , to our test func \\xad\\ntion. This attribute makes a test pass if the code inside the function panics; the test will fail if the code inside the function doesn’t panic.\\nListing 11 \\xad8 shows a test that checks that the error conditions of \\nGuess::new  happen when we expect them to.\\npub struct Guess {\\n    value: u32,\\n}\\nimpl Guess {\\n    pub fn new(value: u32) -> Guess {        if value < 1 || value > 100 {\\n            panic!(\"Guess value must be between 1 and 100, got {}.\", value);\\n        }\\n        Guess {\\n            value\\n        }    }\\n}\\n#[cfg(test)]\\nmod tests {    use super::*;\\n    #[test]\\n    #[should_panic]\\n    fn greater_than_100() {        Guess::new(200);\\n    }\\n}\\nListing 11-8: Testing that a condition will cause a \\npanic!\\nWe place the #[should_panic]  attribute after the #[test]  attribute and before \\nthe test function it applies to.

Now \\nwe can start figuring out where our bug is!\\nNow that you know several ways to write tests, let’s look at what is hap \\xad\\npening when we run our tests and explore the different options we can use \\nwith cargo test .\\nControlling How Tests Are Run\\nJust as cargo run  compiles your code and then runs the resulting binary, cargo \\ntest compiles your code in test mode and runs the resulting test binary. You \\ncan specify command line options to change the default behavior of cargo \\ntest. For example, the default behavior of the binary produced by cargo test  \\nis to run all the tests in parallel and capture output generated during test runs, preventing the output from being displayed and making it easier to read the output related to the test results.\\nSome command line options go to \\ncargo test , and some go to the result \\xad\\ning test binary. To separate these two types of arguments, you list the argu \\xad\\nments that go to cargo test  followed by the separator -- and then the ones \\nthat go to the test binary. Running cargo test --help  displays the options \\nyou can use with cargo test , and running cargo test -- --help  displays the \\noptions you can use after the separator --.\\nRunning Tests in Parallel or Consecutively\\nWhen you run multiple tests, by default they run in parallel using threads. This means the tests will finish running faster so you can get feedback quicker on whether or not your code is working. Because the tests are run \\xad\\nning at the same time, make sure your tests don’t depend on each other or on any shared state, including a shared environment, such as the cur \\xad\\nrent working directory or environment variables.\\nFor example, say each of your tests runs some code that creates a file \\non disk named test-output.txt  and writes some data to that file. Then each \\ntest reads the data in that file and asserts that the file contains a particu \\xad\\nlar value, which is different in each test. Because the tests run at the same time, one test might overwrite the file between when another test writes and reads the file. The second test will then fail, not because the code is incor \\xad\\nrect but because the tests have interfered with each other while running in parallel. One solution is to make sure each test writes to a different file; another solution is to run the tests one at a time.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir\"),\n",

Take a look at the following example:\\n$ cargo test -- --test-threads=1\\nWe set the number of test threads to 1, telling the program not to use \\nany parallelism. Running the tests using one thread will take longer than \\nrunning them in parallel, but the tests won’t interfere with each other if they share state.\\nShowing Function Output\\nBy default, if a test passes, Rust’s test library captures anything printed to standard output. For example, if we call \\nprintln!  in a test and the test \\npasses, we won’t see the println!  output in the terminal; we’ll see only the \\nline that indicates the test passed. If a test fails, we’ll see whatever was printed to standard output with the rest of the failure message.\\nAs an example, Listing 11 \\xad10 has a silly function that prints the value of \\nits parameter and returns 10, as well as a test that passes and a test that fails.\\nfn prints_and_returns_10(a: i32) -> i32 {\\n    println!(\"I got the value {}\", a);\\n    10\\n}\\n#[cfg(test)]\\nmod tests {\\n    use super::*;\\n    #[test]\\n    fn this_test_will_pass() {\\n        let value = prints_and_returns_10(4);\\n        assert_eq!(10, value);    }\\n    #[test]\\n    fn this_test_will_fail() {\\n        let value = prints_and_returns_10(8);        assert_eq!(5, value);\\n    }\\n}\\nListing 11-10: Tests for a function that calls \\nprintln!\\nWhen we run these tests with cargo test , we’ll see the following output:\\nrunning 2 tests\\ntest tests::this_test_will_pass ... ok\\ntest tests::this_test_will_fail ...

The Rust community thinks about tests in terms of two main categories: unit tests  and \\nintegration tests . Unit tests are small and more focused, testing one module \\nin isolation at a time, and can test private interfaces. Integration tests are entirely external to your library and use your code in the same way any other external code would, using only the public interface and potentially exercising multiple modules per test.\\nWriting both kinds of tests is important to ensure that the pieces of \\nyour library are doing what you expect them to, separately and together.\\nUnit Tests\\nThe purpose of unit tests is to test each unit of code in isolation from the rest of the code to quickly pinpoint where code is and isn’t working as expected. \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The convention is to create a module named tests  in each file to con \\xad\\ntain the test functions and to annotate the module with cfg(test) .\\nThe Tests Module and #[cfg(test)]\\nThe #[cfg(test)]  annotation on the tests  module tells Rust to compile and \\nrun the test code only when you run cargo test , not when you run cargo build . \\nThis saves compile time when you only want to build the library and saves \\nspace in the resulting compiled artifact because the tests are not included. You’ll see that because integration tests go in a different directory, they don’t need the \\n#[cfg(test)]  annotation. However, because unit tests go in the same \\nfiles as the code, you’ll use #[cfg(test)]  to specify that they shouldn’t be \\nincluded in the compiled result.\\nRecall that when we generated the new adder  project in the first section \\nof this chapter, Cargo generated this code for us:\\n#[cfg(test)]\\nmod tests {\\n    #[test]\\n    fn it_works() {\\n        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);\\n    }}\\nThis code is the automatically generated test module. The attribute \\ncfg stands for configuration  and tells Rust that the following item should \\nonly be included given a certain configuration option. In this case, the \\nconfiguration option is test, which is provided by Rust for compiling and \\nrunning tests. By using the cfg attribute, Cargo compiles our test code \\nonly if we actively run the tests with cargo test . This includes any helper \\nfunctions that might be within this module, in addition to the functions annotated with \\n#[test] .\\nTesting Private Functions\\nThere’s debate within the testing community about whether or not private \\nfunctions should be tested directly, and other languages make it difficult or impossible to test private functions. Regardless of which testing ideology you adhere to, Rust’s privacy rules do allow you to test private functions. Consider the code in Listing 11 \\xad12 with the private function \\ninternal_adder .\\npub fn add_two(a: i32) -> i32 {\\n    internal_adder(a, 2)\\n}\\nfn internal_adder(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {\\n    a + b\\n}src/lib.rs\\nsrc/lib.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

If you don’t think pri \\xad\\nvate functions should be tested, nothing in Rust will compel you to do so.\\nIntegration Tests\\nIn Rust, integration tests are entirely external to your library. They use your \\nlibrary in the same way any other code would, which means they can only call functions that are part of your library’s public API. Their purpose is to test whether many parts of your library work together correctly. Units of code that work correctly on their own could have problems when integrated, so test coverage of the integrated code is important as well. To create integra \\xad\\ntion tests, you first need a tests  directory.\\nThe tests Directory\\nWe create a tests  directory at the top level of our project directory, next to \\nsrc. Cargo knows to look for integration test files in this directory. We can \\nthen make as many test files as we want to in this directory, and Cargo will \\ncompile each of the files as an individual crate.\\nLet’s create an integration test. With the code in Listing 11 \\xad12 still in the \\nsrc/lib.rs  file, make a tests  directory, create a new file named tests/integration  \\n_test.rs, and enter the code in Listing 11 \\xad13.\\nextern crate adder;\\n#[test]\\nfn it_adds_two() {\\n    assert_eq!(4, adder::add_two(2));\\n}\\nListing 11-13: An integration test of a function in the adder  crate\\nWe’ve added extern crate adder  at the top of the code, which we didn’t \\nneed in the unit tests.

In “Rules of Module \\nFilesystems” on page 117, we used the naming convention module_name/  \\nmod.rs  for files of modules that have submodules. We don’t have submodules \\nfor common  here, but naming the file this way tells Rust not to treat the common  \\nmodule as an integration test file. When we move the setup  function code \\ninto tests/common/mod.rs  and delete the tests/common.rs  file, the section in the \\ntest output will no longer appear. Files in subdirectories of the tests  directory \\ndon’t get compiled as separate crates or have sections in the test output.\\nAfter we’ve created tests/common/mod.rs , we can use it from any of the \\nintegration test files as a module. Here’s an example of calling the setup  \\nfunction from the it_adds_two  test in tests/integration_test.rs :\\nextern crate adder;\\nmod common;#[test]\\nfn it_adds_two() {    common::setup();\\n    assert_eq!(4, adder::add_two(2));\\n}\\nNote that the mod common;  declaration is the same as the module declara \\xad\\ntions we demonstrated in Listing 7 \\xad4 on page 113.

Only \\nlibrary crates expose functions that other crates can call and use; binary \\ncrates are meant to be run on their own.\\nThis is one of the reasons Rust projects that provide a binary have a \\nstraightforward src/main.rs  file that calls logic that lives in the src/lib.rs  file. \\nUsing that structure, integration tests can  test the library crate by using \\nextern crate  to exercise the important functionality.

Now we need to save the values of the two arguments in variables so we can use the values throughout the rest of the program. We do that in Listing 12-2.\\nuse std::env;\\nfn main() {\\n    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();\\n    let query = &args[1];\\n    let filename = &args[2];\\n    println!(\"Searching for {}\", query);\\n    println!(\"In file {}\", filename);\\n}\\nListing 12-2: Creating variables to hold the query argument and filename argument\\nAs we saw when we printed the vector, the program’s name takes up the \\nfirst value in the vector at args[0] , so we’re starting at index 1.

The second argument will be the file -\\nname, so we put a reference to the second argument in the variable filename .\\nWe temporarily print the values of these variables to prove that the code \\nis working as we intend.

The code read and then printed the contents of the file. But the \\ncode has a few flaws. The main function has multiple responsibilities: gener -\\nally, functions are clearer and easier to maintain if each function is respon -\\nsible for only one idea. The other problem is that we’re not handling errors \\nas well as we could. The program is still small, so these flaws aren’t a big prob -\\nlem, but as the program grows, it will be harder to fix them cleanly. It’s good practice to begin refactoring early on when developing a program, because it’s much easier to refactor smaller amounts of code. We’ll do that next.\\nRefactoring to Improve Modularity and Error Handling\\nTo improve our program, we’ll fix four problems that have to do with the program’s structure and how it’s handling potential errors.\\nFirst, our \\nmain function now performs two tasks: it parses arguments \\nand opens files. For such a small function, this isn’t a major problem. \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir\"),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 262}, page_content='An I/O Project: Building a Command Line Program    233However, if we continue to grow our program inside main, the number of \\nseparate tasks the main function handles will increase. As a function gains \\nresponsibilities, it becomes more difficult to reason about, harder to test, \\nand harder to change without breaking one of its parts. It’s best to separate functionality so each function is responsible for one task.\\nThis issue ties into the second problem: although \\nquery  and filename  are \\nconfiguration variables to our program, variables like f and contents  are used \\nto perform the program’s logic. The longer main becomes, the more variables \\nwe’ll need to bring into scope; the more variables we have in scope, the harder it will be to keep track of the purpose of each. It’s best to group the configuration variables into one structure to make their purpose clear.\\nThe third problem is that we’ve used \\nexpect  to print an error message \\nwhen opening the file fails, but the error message just prints file not found . \\nOpening a file can fail in a number of ways besides the file being missing: for example, the file might exist, but we might not have permission to open it. Right now, if we’re in that situation, we’d print the \\nfile not found  error \\nmessage, which would give the user the wrong information!\\nFourth, we use expect  repeatedly to handle different errors, and if the \\nuser runs our program without specifying enough arguments, they’ll get an \\nindex out of bounds  error from Rust that doesn’t clearly explain the problem. It \\nwould be best if all the error-handling code were in one place so future main -\\ntainers had only one place to consult in the code if the error-handling logic needed to change. Having all the error-handling code in one place will also ensure that we’re printing messages that will be meaningful to our end users.\\nLet’s address these four problems by refactoring our project.\\nSeparation of Concerns for Binary Projects\\nThe organizational problem of allocating responsibility for multiple tasks to the \\nmain function is common to many binary projects. As a result, the Rust \\ncommunity has developed a process to use as a guideline for splitting the separate concerns of a binary program when \\nmain starts getting large. The \\nprocess has the following steps:\\n•\\tSplit your program into a main.rs  and a lib.rs  and move your program’s \\nlogic to lib.rs .\\n•\\tAs long as your command line parsing logic is small, it can remain in \\nmain.rs .\\n•\\tWhen the command line parsing logic starts getting complicated, extract it from main.rs  and move it to lib.rs .\\nThe responsibilities that remain in the \\nmain function after this process \\nshould be limited to the following:\\n•\\tCalling the command line parsing logic with the argument values\\n•\\tSetting up any other configuration\\n•\\tCalling a run function in lib.rs\\n•\\tHandling the error if run returns an error \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 263}, page_content='234   Chapter 12This pattern is about separating concerns: main.rs  handles running the \\nprogram, and lib.rs  handles all the logic of the task at hand. Because you \\ncan’t test the main function directly, this structure lets you test all of your \\nprogram’s logic by moving it into functions in lib.rs . The only code that \\nremains in main.rs  will be small enough to verify its correctness by reading \\nit. Let’s rework our program by following this process.\\nExtracting the Argument Parser\\nWe’ll extract the functionality for parsing arguments into a function that main \\nwill call to prepare for moving the command line parsing logic to src/lib.rs . \\nListing 12-5 shows the new start of main that calls a new function parse_config , \\nwhich we’ll define in src/main.rs  for the moment.\\nfn main() {\\n    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();\\n    let (query, filename) = parse_config(&args);    // --snip--\\n}\\nfn parse_config(args: &[String]) -> (&str, &str) {\\n    let query = &args[1];\\n    let filename = &args[2];\\n    (query, filename)\\n}\\nListing 12-5: Extracting a \\nparse_config  function from main\\nWe’re still collecting the command line arguments into a vector, but \\ninstead of assigning the argument value at index 1 to the variable query  and \\nthe argument value at index 2 to the variable filename  within the main func -\\ntion, we pass the whole vector to the parse_config  function. The parse_config  \\nfunction then holds the logic that determines which argument goes in \\nwhich variable and passes the values back to main. We still create the query  \\nand filename  variables in main, but main no longer has the responsibility of \\ndetermining how the command line arguments and variables correspond.\\nThis rework may seem like overkill for our small program, but we’re \\nrefactoring in small, incremental steps. After making this change, run the program again to verify that the argument parsing still works. It’s good to check your progress often to help identify the cause of problems when they occur.\\nGrouping Configuration Values\\nWe can take another small step to improve the \\nparse_config  function further. \\nAt the moment, we’re returning a tuple, but then we immediately break that \\ntuple into individual parts again. This is a sign that perhaps we don’t have the right abstraction yet.src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

We’re not currently conveying \\nthis meaning in the structure of the data other than by grouping the two values into a tuple; we could put the two values into one struct and give each of the struct fields a meaningful name. Doing so will make it easier for future maintainers of this code to understand how the different values relate to each other and what their purpose is.\\nnO te Some people call this anti-pattern of using primitive values when a complex type would be more appropriate primitive obsession .\\nListing 12-6 shows the improvements to the \\nparse_config  function.\\nfn main() {\\n    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();\\n    u let config = parse_config(&args);\\n    println!(\"Searching for {}\", config.queryv );\\n    println!(\"In file {}\", config.filenamew );\\n    let mut f = File::open(config.filenamex ).expect(\"file not found\");\\n    // --snip--\\n}\\ny struct Config {\\n    query: String,\\n    filename: String,\\n}\\nz fn parse_config(args: &[String]) -> Config {    { let query = args[1].clone();\\n    | let filename = args[2].clone();\\n    Config { query, filename }}\\nListing 12-6: Refactoring \\nparse_config  to return an instance of a Config  struct\\nWe’ve added a struct named Config  defined to have fields named query  \\nand filename  y. The signature of parse_config  now indicates that it returns \\na Config  value  z. In the body of parse_config , where we used to return string \\nslices that reference String  values in args, we now define Config  to contain \\nowned String  values. The args variable in main is the owner of the argument \\nvalues and is only letting the parse_config  function borrow them, which \\nmeans we’d violate Rust’s borrowing rules if Config  tried to take ownership \\nof the values in args.\\nWe could manage the String  data in a number of different ways, but the \\neasiest, though somewhat inefficient, route is to call the clone  method on src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

This will make a full copy of the data for the Config  instance \\nto own, which takes more time and memory than storing a reference to the \\nstring data. However, cloning the data also makes our code very straight -\\nforward because we don’t have to manage the lifetimes of the references; in this circumstance, giving up a little performance to gain simplicity is a worthwhile trade-off.\\nthe t rAde-O FFs OF u sIng cl One\\nThere’s a tendency among many Rustaceans to avoid using clone  to fix owner -\\nship problems because of its runtime cost. In Chapter 13, you’ll learn how to \\nuse more efficient methods in this type of situation. But for now, it’s okay to \\ncopy a few strings to continue making progress because you’ll make these \\ncopies only once and your filename and query string are very small. It’s better \\nto have a working program that’s a bit inefficient than to try to hyperoptimize \\ncode on your first pass. As you become more experienced with Rust, it’ll be \\neasier to start with the most efficient solution, but for now, it’s perfectly accept -\\nable to call clone .\\nWe’ve updated main so it places the instance of Config  returned by \\nparse_config  into a variable named config  u, and we updated the code that \\npreviously used the separate query  and filename  variables so it now uses the \\nfields on the Config  struct instead vwx .\\nNow our code more clearly conveys that query  and filename  are related \\nand that their purpose is to configure how the program will work. Any \\ncode that uses these values knows to find them in the config  instance in \\nthe fields named for their purpose.\\nCreating a Constructor for Config\\nSo far, we’ve extracted the logic responsible for parsing the command line \\narguments from main and placed it in the parse_config  function. Doing so \\nhelped us to see that the query  and filename  values were related and that rela -\\ntionship should be conveyed in our code. We then added a Config  struct to \\nname the related purpose of query  and filename  and to be able to return the \\nvalues’ names as struct field names from the parse_config  function.\\nSo now that the purpose of the parse_config  function is to create a \\nConfig  instance, we can change parse_config  from a plain function to a func -\\ntion named new that is associated with the Config  struct. Making this change \\nwill make the code more idiomatic. We can create instances of types in the standard library, such as \\nString , by calling String::new . Similarly, by chang -\\ning parse_config  into a new function associated with Config , we’ll be able \\nto create instances of Config  by calling Config::new .

Listing 12-12 shows the changes we need to make to the signa -\\nture and body of run.\\nu use std::error::Error;\\n// --snip--\\nv fn run(config: Config) -> Result<(), Box<Error>> {\\n    let mut f = File::open(config.filename)?w ;\\n    let mut contents = String::new();\\n    f.read_to_string(&mut contents)?x ;\\n    println!(\"With text:\\\\n{}\", contents);\\n    y Ok(())\\n}\\nListing 12-12: Changing the run function to return Result\\nWe’ve made three significant changes here. First, we changed the \\nreturn type of the run function to Result<(), Box<Error>>  v. This function \\npreviously returned the unit type, (), and we keep that as the value \\nreturned in the Ok case.\\nFor the error type, we used the trait object Box<Error>  (and we’ve brought \\nstd::error::Error  into scope with a use statement at the top u ). We’ll cover \\ntrait objects in Chapter 17. For now, just know that Box<Error>  means the func -\\ntion will return a type that implements the Error  trait, but we don’t have to \\nspecify what particular type the return value will be. This gives us flexibility \\nto return error values that may be of different types in different error cases.\\nSecond, we’ve removed the calls to expect  in favor of the ? operator wx , \\nas we talked about in Chapter 9. Rather than panic!  on an error, the ? oper -\\nator will return the error value from the current function for the caller to handle.\\nThird, the \\nrun function now returns an Ok value in the success case y . \\nWe’ve declared the run function’s success type as () in the signature, which \\nmeans we need to wrap the unit type value in the Ok value. This Ok(())  syntax \\nmight look a bit strange at first, but using () like this is the idiomatic way to \\nindicate that we’re calling run for its side effects only; it doesn’t return a value \\nwe need.src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

But we’re not checking to see whether \\nor not there was an error, and the compiler reminds us that we probably meant to have some error-handling code here! Let’s rectify that problem now.\\nHandling Errors Returned from run in main\\nWe’ll check for errors and handle them using a technique similar to the \\none we used with \\nConfig::new  in Listing 12-10, but with a slight difference:\\nfn main() {\\n    // --snip--\\n    println!(\"Searching for {}\", config.query);\\n    println!(\"In file {}\", config.filename);\\n    if let Err(e) = run(config) {\\n        println!(\"Application error: {}\", e);\\n        process::exit(1);\\n    }\\n}\\nWe use if let  rather than unwrap_or_else  to check whether run returns an \\nErr value and call process::exit(1)  if it does. The run function doesn’t return \\na value that we want to unwrap  in the same way that Config::new  returns the \\nConfig  instance. Because run returns () in the success case, we only care about \\ndetecting an error, so we don’t need unwrap_or_else  to return the unwrapped \\nvalue because it would only be ().\\nThe bodies of the if let  and the unwrap_or_else  functions are the same \\nin both cases: we print the error and exit.\\nSplitting Code into a Library Crate\\nOur minigrep  project is looking good so far! Now we’ll split the src/main.rs  \\nfile and put some code into the src/lib.rs  file so we can test it and have a src/\\nmain.rs  file with fewer responsibilities.\\nLet’s move all the code that isn’t the main function from src/main.rs  to \\nsrc/lib.rs :\\n•\\tThe run function definition\\n•\\tThe relevant use statementssrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Feel free to write some tests for the functionality in the \\nConfig::new  and run functions on your own.\\nIn this section, we’ll add the searching logic to the minigrep  program by \\nusing the test-driven development (TDD) process. This software develop -\\nment technique follows these steps:\\n1. Write a test that fails and run it to make sure it fails for the reason you \\nexpect.\\n2. Write or modify just enough code to make the new test pass.\\n3. Refactor the code you just added or changed and make sure the tests continue to pass.\\n4. Repeat from step 1!\\nThis process is just one of many ways to write software, but TDD can \\nhelp drive code design as well. Writing the test before you write the code \\nthat makes the test pass helps to maintain high test coverage throughout the process.\\nWe’ll test drive the implementation of the functionality that will actu -\\nally do the searching for the query string in the file contents and produce a list of lines that match the query. We’ll add this functionality in a function called \\nsearch .\\nWriting a Failing Test\\nBecause we don’t need them anymore, let’s remove the println!  statements \\nfrom src/lib.rs  and src/main.rs  that we used to check the program’s behavior. \\nThen, in src/lib.rs , we’ll add a test module with a test function, as we did \\nin Chapter 11.

You can create the closure in one place and then call the closure to evaluate it in a different context. Unlike func -\\ntions, closures can capture values from the scope in which they’re called. We’ll demonstrate how these closure features allow for code reuse and behavior customization.\\nCreating an Abstraction of Behavior with Closures\\nLet’s work on an example of a situation in which it’s useful to store a closure to be executed later. Along the way, we’ll talk about the syntax of closures, type inference, and traits.\\nConsider this hypothetical situation: we work at a startup that’s making \\nan app to generate custom exercise workout plans. The backend is written in Rust, and the algorithm that generates the workout plan takes into account many factors, such as the app user’s age, body mass index, exercise prefer -\\nences, recent workouts, and an intensity number they specify. The actual algorithm used isn’t important in this example; what’s important is that this calculation takes a few seconds. We want to call this algorithm only when we need to and only call it once so we don’t make the user wait more than necessary. \\nWe’ll simulate calling this hypothetical algorithm with the function \\nsimulated_expensive_calculation  shown in Listing 13-1, which will print \\ncalculating slowly... , wait for 2 seconds, and then return whatever num -\\nber we passed in.\\nuse std::thread;\\nuse std::time::Duration;\\nfn simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity: u32) -> u32 {\\n    println!(\"calculating slowly...\");\\n    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));    intensity\\n}\\nListing 13-1: A function to stand in for a hypothetical calculation that takes about  \\n2 seconds to runsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

This function represents the code that the app \\nwill call when a user asks for a workout plan. Because the interaction with the app’s frontend isn’t relevant to the use of closures, we’ll hardcode values representing inputs to our program and print the outputs.\\nThe required inputs are these:\\n•\\tAn intensity number from the user, which is specified when they request a workout to indicate whether they want a low-intensity workout or a high-intensity workout\\n•\\tA random number that will generate some variety in the workout plans\\nThe output will be the recommended workout plan. Listing 13-2 shows \\nthe \\nmain function we’ll use.\\nfn main() {\\n    let simulated_user_specified_value = 10;\\n    let simulated_random_number = 7;\\n    generate_workout(\\n        simulated_user_specified_value,         simulated_random_number\\n    );\\n}\\nListing 13-2: A \\nmain function with hardcoded values to simulate user input and random \\nnumber generation\\nWe’ve hardcoded the variable simulated_user_specified_value  as 10 and \\nthe variable simulated_random_number  as 7 for simplicity’s sake; in an actual \\nprogram, we’d get the intensity number from the app’s frontend, and we’d \\nuse the rand crate to generate a random number, as we did in the Guessing \\nGame example in Chapter 2. The main function calls a generate_workout  func -\\ntion with the simulated input values.\\nNow that we have the context, let’s get to the algorithm. The function \\ngenerate_workout  in Listing 13-3 contains the business logic of the app that \\nwe’re most concerned with in this example. The rest of the code changes in this example will be made to this function.\\nfn generate_workout(intensity: u32, random_number: u32) {\\n    \\uf075 if intensity < 25 {\\n        println!(\\n            \"Today, do {} pushups!\",\\n            simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity)\\n        );        println!(\\n            \"Next, do {} situps!\",\\n            simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity)        );\\n    } else {\\n        \\uf076 if random_number == 3 {\\n            println!(\"Take a break today!

If not, the user will get a number of minutes of running based on the complex algorithm.\\nThis code works the way the business wants it to now, but let’s say the \\ndata science team decides that we need to make some changes to the way we call the \\nsimulated_expensive_calculation  function in the future.

To define a closure, we start with a pair of vertical pipes \\n(|), inside which we specify the parameters to the closure; this syntax was \\nchosen because of its similarity to closure definitions in Smalltalk and Ruby. \\nThis closure has one parameter named num: if we had more than one param -\\neter, we would separate them with commas, like |param1, param2| .\\nAfter the parameters, we place curly brackets that hold the body of the \\nclosure—these are optional if the closure body is a single expression. The end of the closure, after the curly brackets, needs a semicolon to complete the \\nlet statement. The value returned from the last line in the closure body \\n(num) will be the value returned from the closure when it’s called, because \\nthat line doesn’t end in a semicolon, just as in function bodies.src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Type annotations are required on functions \\nbecause they’re part of an explicit interface exposed to your users. Defining this interface rigidly is important for ensuring that everyone agrees on what types of values a function uses and returns. But closures aren’t used in an exposed interface like this: they’re stored in variables and used without nam -\\ning them and exposing them to users of our library.\\nClosures are usually short and relevant only within a narrow context \\nrather than in any arbitrary scenario. Within these limited contexts, the compiler is reliably able to infer the types of the parameters and the return type, similar to how it’s able to infer the types of most variables.\\nMaking programmers annotate the types in these small, anonymous \\nfunctions would be annoying and largely redundant with the information the compiler already has available.\\nAs with variables, we can add type annotations if we want to increase \\nexplicitness and clarity at the cost of being more verbose than is strictly necessary. Annotating the types for the closure we defined in Listing 13-5 would look like the definition shown in Listing 13-7.\\nlet expensive_closure = |num: u32| -> u32 {\\n    println!(\"calculating slowly...\");\\n    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));\\n    num\\n};\\nListing 13-7: Adding optional type annotations of the parameter and return value types in \\nthe closure\\nWith type annotations added, the syntax of closures looks more similar \\nto the syntax of functions. The following is a vertical comparison of the syn -\\ntax for the definition of a function that adds 1 to its parameter and a closure \\nthat has the same behavior. We’ve added some spaces to line up the relevant parts. This illustrates how closure syntax is similar to function syntax except for the use of pipes and the amount of syntax that is optional:\\nfn  add_one_v1   (x: u32) -> u32 { x + 1 }\\nlet add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -> u32 { x + 1 };\\nlet add_one_v3 = |x|             { x + 1 };\\nlet add_one_v4 = |x|               x + 1  ;\\nThe first line shows a function definition, and the second line shows a \\nfully annotated closure definition. The third line removes the type annota -\\ntions from the closure definition, and the fourth line removes the brackets, \\nwhich are optional because the closure body has only one expression. These are all valid definitions that will produce the same behavior when they’re called.\\nClosure definitions will have one concrete type inferred for each of their \\nparameters and for their return value.

Those \\ntypes are then locked into the closure in example_closure , and we get a type \\nerror if we try to use a different type with the same closure.\\nStoring Closures Using Generic Parameters and the Fn Traits\\nLet’s return to our workout generation app. In Listing 13-6, our code was \\nstill calling the expensive calculation closure more times than it needed to. One option to solve this issue is to save the result of the expensive closure in a variable for reuse and use the variable in each place we need the result, instead of calling the closure again. However, this method could result in a lot of repeated code.\\nFortunately, another solution is available to us. We can create a struct \\nthat will hold the closure and the resulting value of calling the closure. The struct will execute the closure only if we need the resulting value, and it will cache the resulting value so the rest of our code doesn’t have to be responsible for saving and reusing the result. You may know this pattern as memoization  or lazy evaluation .\\nTo make a struct that holds a closure, we need to specify the type of the \\nclosure, because a struct definition needs to know the types of each of its fields. Each closure instance has its own unique anonymous type: that is, even if two closures have the same signature, their types are still considered differ -\\nent. To define structs, enums, or function parameters that use closures, we use generics and trait bounds, as we discussed in Chapter 10.src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

In this case, our closure has a parameter of type \\nu32 and returns a u32, so the \\ntrait bound we specify is Fn(u32) -> u32 .\\nListing 13-9 shows the definition of the Cacher  struct that holds a closure \\nand an optional result value.\\nstruct Cacher<T>\\n    where T: Fn(u32) -> u32\\n{\\n    calculation: T,\\n    value: Option<u32>,\\n}\\nListing 13-9: Defining a Cacher  struct that holds a closure in calculation  and an optional \\nresult in value\\nThe Cacher  struct has a calculation  field of the generic type T. The trait \\nbounds on T specify that it’s a closure by using the Fn trait. Any closure we \\nwant to store in the calculation  field must have one u32 parameter (specified \\nwithin the parentheses after Fn) and must return a u32 (specified after the ->).\\nnote  Functions implement all three of the Fn traits, too. If what we want to do doesn’t require \\ncapturing a value from the environment, we can use a function rather than a closure \\nwhere we need something that implements an Fn trait.\\nThe value  field is of type Option<u32> . Before we execute the closure, value  \\nwill be None. When code using a Cacher  asks for the result  of the closure, the \\nCacher  will execute the closure at that time and store the result within a Some \\nvariant in the value  field. Then if the code asks for the result of the closure \\nagain, instead of executing the closure again, the Cacher  will return the result \\nheld in the Some variant. \\nThe logic around the value  field we’ve just described is defined in \\nListing  13-10.\\nimpl<T> Cacher<T>\\n    \\uf075 where T: Fn(u32) -> u32\\n{\\n    \\uf076 fn new(calculation: T) -> Cacher<T> {\\n        \\uf077 Cacher {\\n            calculation,\\n            value: None,\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\uf078 fn value(&mut self, arg: u32) -> u32 {\\n        match self.value {src/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Then, in each place we want \\nthe result \\uf076\\uf077\\uf078 , we call the value  method on the Cacher  instance. We can \\ncall the value  method as many times as we want, or not call it at all, and the \\nexpensive calculation will be run a maximum of once. \\nTry running this program with the main function from Listing 13-2. \\nChange the values in the simulated_user_specified_value  and simulated_random_\\nnumber  variables to verify that in all the cases in the various if and else blocks, \\ncalculating slowly...  appears only once and only when needed.

However, there are two prob -\\nlems with the current implementation of Cacher  that would make reusing it in \\ndifferent contexts difficult.\\nThe first problem is that a Cacher  instance assumes it will always get the \\nsame value for the parameter arg to the value  method. That is, this test of \\nCacher  will fail:\\n#[test]\\nfn call_with_different_values() {\\n    let mut c = Cacher::new(|a| a);\\n    let v1 = c.value(1);\\n    let v2 = c.value(2);\\n    assert_eq!(v2, 2);\\n}\\nThis test creates a new Cacher  instance with a closure that returns the \\nvalue passed into it. We call the value  method on this Cacher  instance with \\nan arg value of 1 and then an arg value of 2, and we expect the call to value  \\nwith the arg value of 2 to return 2.\\nRun this test with the Cacher  implementation in Listing 13-9 and \\nListing 13-10, and the test will fail on the assert_eq!  with this message:\\nthread 'call_with_different_values' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`\\n  left: `1`,\\n right: `2`', src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir\"),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 297}, page_content='268   Chapter 13The problem is that the first time we called c.value  with 1, the Cacher  \\ninstance saved Some(1)  in self.value . Thereafter, no matter what we pass in \\nto the value  method, it will always return 1.\\nTry modifying Cacher  to hold a hash map rather than a single value. \\nThe keys of the hash map will be the arg values that are passed in, and the \\nvalues of the hash map will be the result of calling the closure on that key. \\nInstead of looking at whether self.value  directly has a Some or a None value, \\nthe value  function will look up the arg in the hash map and return the value \\nif it’s present. If it’s not present, the Cacher  will call the closure and save the \\nresulting value in the hash map associated with its arg value.\\nThe second problem with the current Cacher  implementation is that it \\nonly accepts closures that take one parameter of type u32 and return a u32. \\nWe might want to cache the results of closures that take a string slice and return \\nusize  values, for example. To fix this issue, try introducing more \\ngeneric parameters to increase the flexibility of the Cacher  functionality.\\nCapturing the Environment with Closures\\nIn the workout generator example, we only used closures as inline anony -\\nmous functions. However, closures have an additional capability that func -\\ntions don’t have: they can capture their environment and access variables from the scope in which they’re defined.\\nListing 13-12 has an example of a closure stored in the \\nequal_to_x  vari-\\nable that uses the x variable from the closure’s surrounding environment.\\nfn main() {\\n    let x = 4;\\n    let equal_to_x = |z| z == x;    let y = 4;    assert!(equal_to_x(y));\\n}\\nListing 13-12: Example of a closure that refers to a variable in its enclosing scope\\nHere, even though x is not one of the parameters of equal_to_x , the \\nequal_to_x  closure is allowed to use the x variable that’s defined in the same \\nscope that equal_to_x  is defined in.\\nWe can’t do the same with functions; if we try with the following example, \\nour code won’t compile:\\nfn main() {\\n    let x = 4;\\n    fn equal_to_x(z: i32) -> bool { z == x }    let y = 4;src/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

This use of memory is over -\\nhead that we don’t want to pay in more common cases where we want to execute code that doesn’t capture its environment. Because functions are never allowed to capture their environment, defining and using functions will never incur this overhead.\\nClosures can capture values from their environment in three ways, \\nwhich directly map to the three ways a function can take a parameter: tak -\\ning ownership, borrowing mutably, and borrowing immutably. These are encoded in the three \\nFn traits as follows:\\n•\\tFnOnce  consumes the variables it captures from its enclosing scope, known \\nas the closure’s environment . To consume the captured variables, the clo -\\nsure must take ownership of these variables and move them into the closure when it is defined. The \\nOnce part of the name represents the fact \\nthat the closure can’t take ownership of the same variables more than once, so it can be called only once.\\n•\\t\\nFnMut  can change the environment because it mutably borrows values.\\n•\\tFn borrows values from the environment immutably.\\nWhen you create a closure, Rust infers which trait to use based on how \\nthe closure uses the values from the environment. All closures implement \\nFnOnce  because they can all be called at least once. Closures that don’t move \\nthe captured variables also implement FnMut , and closures that don’t need \\nmutable access to the captured variables also implement Fn. In Listing 13-12, \\nthe equal_to_x  closure borrows x immutably (so equal_to_x  has the Fn trait) \\nbecause the body of the closure only needs to read the value in x.\\nIf you want to force the closure to take ownership of the values it uses \\nin the environment, you can use the move keyword before the parameter list. \\nThis technique is mostly useful when passing a closure to a new thread to move the data so it’s owned by the new thread. \\nWe’ll have more examples of \\nmove closures in Chapter 16 when we talk \\nabout concurrency. For now, here’s the code from Listing 13-12 with the \\nmove keyword added to the closure definition and using vectors instead of \\nintegers, because integers can be copied rather than moved; note that this code will not yet compile.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir\"),\n",

Removing \\nprintln!  will fix this example.\\nMost of the time when specifying one of the Fn trait bounds, you can \\nstart with Fn and the compiler will tell you if you need FnMut  or FnOnce  based on \\nwhat happens in the closure body.\\nTo illustrate situations where closures that can capture their environment \\nare useful as function parameters, let’s move on to our next topic: iterators.\\nProcessing a Series of Items with Iterators\\nThe iterator pattern allows you to perform some task on a sequence of items \\nin turn. An iterator is responsible for the logic of iterating over each item and determining when the sequence has finished. When you use iterators, you don’t have to reimplement that logic yourself.\\nIn Rust, iterators are lazy , meaning they have no effect until you call \\nmethods that consume the iterator to use it up. For example, the code in Listing 13-13 creates an iterator over the items in the vector \\nv1 by calling \\nthe iter method defined on Vec<T> . This code by itself doesn’t do anything \\nuseful.src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

In \\nListing 3-5, we used iterators with for loops to execute some code on each \\nitem, although we glossed over what the call to iter did until now. \\nThe example in Listing 13-14 separates the creation of the iterator from \\nthe use of the iterator in the for loop. The iterator is stored in the v1_iter  \\nvariable, and no iteration takes place at that time. When the for loop is called \\nusing the iterator in v1_iter , each element in the iterator is used in one itera -\\ntion of the loop, which prints each value.\\nlet v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];\\nlet v1_iter = v1.iter();for val in v1_iter {\\n    println!(\"Got: {}\", val);}\\nListing 13-14: Using an iterator in a \\nfor loop\\nIn languages that don’t have iterators provided by their standard \\nlibraries, you would likely write this same functionality by starting a vari -\\nable at index 0, using that variable to index into the vector to get a value, \\nand incrementing the variable value in a loop until it reached the total number of items in the vector. \\nIterators handle all that logic for you, cutting down on repetitive code \\nyou could potentially mess up. Iterators give you more flexibility to use the same logic with many different kinds of sequences, not just data structures you can index into, like vectors. Let’s examine how iterators do that.\\nThe Iterator Trait and the next Method\\nAll iterators implement a trait named Iterator  that is defined in the standard \\nlibrary. The definition of the trait looks like this:\\npub trait Iterator {\\n    type Item;\\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;    // methods with default implementations elided\\n}\\nNotice this definition uses some new syntax: type Item  and Self::Item , \\nwhich are defining an associated type  with this trait. We’ll talk about associated \\ntypes in depth in Chapter 19. For now, all you need to know is that this code \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

In other \\nwords, the Item type will be the type returned from the iterator.\\nThe Iterator  trait only requires implementors to define one method: \\nthe next method, which returns one item of the iterator at a time wrapped \\nin Some and, when iteration is over, returns None. \\nWe can call the next method on iterators directly; Listing 13-15 demon -\\nstrates what values are returned from repeated calls to next on the iterator \\ncreated from the vector.\\n#[test]\\nfn iterator_demonstration() {\\n    let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];\\n    let mut v1_iter = v1.iter();\\n    assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), Some(&1));\\n    assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), Some(&2));\\n    assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), Some(&3));\\n    assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), None);\\n}\\nListing 13-15: Calling the next method on an iterator\\nNote that we needed to make v1_iter  mutable: calling the next method \\non an iterator changes internal state that the iterator uses to keep track of \\nwhere it is in the sequence. In other words, this code consumes , or uses up, \\nthe iterator. Each call to next eats up an item from the iterator. We didn’t \\nneed to make v1_iter  mutable when we used a for loop because the loop \\ntook ownership of v1_iter  and made it mutable behind the scenes.\\nAlso note that the values we get from the calls to next are immutable \\nreferences to the values in the vector. The iter method produces an iterator \\nover immutable references. If we want to create an iterator that takes own -\\nership of v1 and returns owned values, we can call into_iter  instead of iter. \\nSimilarly, if we want to iterate over mutable references, we can call iter_mut  \\ninstead of iter.\\nMethods That Consume the Iterator\\nThe Iterator  trait has a number of different methods with default imple -\\nmentations provided by the standard library; you can find out about these methods by looking in the standard library API documentation for the \\nIterator  trait. Some of these methods call the next method in their defini -\\ntion, which is why you’re required to implement the next method when \\nimplementing the Iterator  trait.\\nMethods that call next are referred to as consuming adaptors , because \\ncalling them uses up the iterator. One example is the sum method, which \\ntakes ownership of the iterator and iterates through the items by repeatedly calling \\nnext, thus consuming the iterator. As it iterates through, it adds each \\nitem to a running total and returns the total when iteration is complete.

You can create iterators from the other collection types \\nin the standard library, such as hash map. You can also create iterators that do anything you want by implementing the \\nIterator  trait on your own types. \\nAs previously mentioned, the only method you’re required to provide a defi -\\nnition for is the next method.

To return ownership of \\na Config  instance, we had to clone the values from the query  and filename  fields \\nof Config  so the Config  instance can own its values.\\nWith our new knowledge about iterators, we can change the new function \\nto take ownership of an iterator as its argument instead of borrowing a slice. \\nWe’ll use the iterator functionality instead of the code that checks the length of the slice and indexes into specific locations. This will clarify what the \\nConfig::new  function is doing because the iterator will access the values.\\nOnce Config::new  takes ownership of the iterator and stops using indexing \\noperations that borrow, we can move the String  values from the iterator into \\nConfig  rather than calling clone  and making a new allocation.\\nUsing the Returned Iterator Directly\\nOpen your I/O project’s src/main.rs  file, which should look like this:\\nfn main() {\\n    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();\\n    let config = Config::new(&args).unwrap_or_else(|err| {\\n        eprintln!(\"Problem parsing arguments: {}\", err);\\n        process::exit(1);    });\\n    // --snip--\\n}src/lib.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

If it returns None, it means not enough arguments \\nwere given and we return early with an Err value.

Most Rust programmers prefer to use the iterator style. It’s a bit tougher to get the hang of at first, but once you get a feel for the various iterator adaptors and what they do, iterators can be easier to understand. Instead of fiddling with the various bits of looping and building new vectors, the code focuses on the high-level objective of the loop. This abstracts away some of the commonplace code so it’s easier to see the concepts that are unique to this code, such as the filtering condition each element in the iterator must pass.\\nBut are the two implementations truly equivalent? The intuitive assump -\\ntion might be that the more low-level loop will be faster. Let’s talk about performance.\\nComparing Performance: Loops vs. Iterators\\nTo determine whether to use loops or iterators, you need to know which ver -\\nsion of the search  function is faster: the version with an explicit for loop or \\nthe version with iterators.\\nWe ran a benchmark by loading the entire contents of The Adventures of \\nSherlock Holmes  by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle into a String  and looking for the \\nword the  in the contents. Here are the results of the benchmark on the ver -\\nsion of search  using the for loop and the version using iterators:\\ntest bench_search_for  ... bench:  19,620,300 ns/iter (+/- 915,700)\\ntest bench_search_iter ... bench:  19,234,900 ns/iter (+/- 657,200)\\nThe iterator version was slightly faster! We won’t explain the benchmark \\ncode here, because the point is not to prove that the two versions are equiva -\\nlent but to get a general sense of how these two implementations compare \\nperformance-wise. src/lib.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir\"),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 311}, page_content='282   Chapter 13For a more comprehensive benchmark, you should check using vari -\\nous texts of various sizes as the contents, different words, words of dif -\\nferent lengths as the query, and all kinds of other variations. The point \\nis this: iterators, although a high-level abstraction, get compiled down to roughly the same code as if you’d written the lower-level code yourself. Iterators are one of Rust’s zero-cost abstractions , by which we mean using the \\nabstraction imposes no additional runtime overhead. This is analogous to how Bjarne Stroustrup, the original designer and implementor of C++, defines zero-overhead  in “Foundations of C++” (2012):\\nIn general, C++ implementations obey the zero-overhead prin -\\nciple: What you don’t use, you don’t pay for. And further: What \\nyou do use, you couldn’t hand code any better.\\nAs another example, the following code is taken from an audio decoder. \\nThe decoding algorithm uses the linear prediction mathematical operation \\nto estimate future values based on a linear function of the previous samples. This code uses an iterator chain to do some math on three variables in scope: a \\nbuffer  slice of data, an array of 12 coefficients , and an amount by which to \\nshift data in qlp_shift . We’ve declared the variables within this example but \\nnot given them any values; although this code doesn’t have much meaning outside of its context, it’s still a concise, real-world example of how Rust trans -\\nlates high-level ideas to low-level code.\\nlet buffer: &mut [i32];\\nlet coefficients: [i64; 12];\\nlet qlp_shift: i16;\\nfor i in 12..buffer.len() {\\n    let prediction = coefficients.iter()                                 .zip(&buffer[i - 12..i])\\n                                 .map(|(&c, &s)| c * s as i64)\\n                                 .sum::<i64>() >> qlp_shift;\\n    let delta = buffer[i];\\n    buffer[i] = prediction as i32 + delta;\\n}\\nTo calculate the value of prediction , this code iterates through each of \\nthe 12 values in coefficients  and uses the zip method to pair the coefficient \\nvalues with the previous 12 values in buffer . Then, for each pair, we multiply \\nthe values together, sum all the results, and shift the bits in the sum qlp_shift  \\nbits to the right.\\nCalculations in applications like audio decoders often prioritize perfor -\\nmance most highly. Here, we’re creating an iterator, using two adaptors, and \\nthen consuming the value. What assembly code would this Rust code com -\\npile to? Well, as of this writing, it compiles down to the same assembly you’d write by hand. There’s no loop at all corresponding to the iteration over the values in \\ncoefficients : Rust knows that there are 12 iterations, so it “unrolls” \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Unrolling  is an optimization that removes the overhead of the loop-\\ncontrolling code and instead generates repetitive code for each iteration of \\nthe loop.\\nAll of the coefficients get stored in registers, which means accessing the \\nvalues is very fast. There are no bounds checks on the array access at run -\\ntime. All these optimizations that Rust is able to apply make the resulting code extremely efficient. Now that you know this, you can use iterators and closures without fear! They make code seem like it’s higher level but don’t impose a runtime performance penalty for doing so.\\nSummary\\nClosures and iterators are Rust features inspired by functional programming language ideas. They contribute to Rust’s capability to clearly express high-level ideas at low-level performance. The implementations of closures and iterators are such that runtime performance is not affected. This is part of Rust’s goal to strive to provide zero-cost abstractions.\\nNow that we’ve improved the expressiveness of our I/O project, let’s \\nlook at some more features of \\ncargo  that will help us share the project with \\nthe world.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Each profile is configured independently of the others.\\nCargo has two main profiles: the \\ndev profile Cargo uses when you run \\ncargo build  and the release  profile Cargo uses when you run cargo build \\n--release . The dev profile is defined with good defaults for development, \\nand the release  profile has good defaults for release builds.\\nThese profile names might be familiar from the output of your builds: \\n$ cargo build\\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs\\n$ cargo build --release\\n    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.0 secs\\nThe dev and release  shown in this build output indicate that the compiler \\nis using different profiles.\\nCargo has default settings for each of the profiles that apply when there \\naren’t any [profile.*]  sections in the project’s Cargo.toml  file. By adding \\n[profile.*]  sections for any profile you want to customize, you can over -\\nride any subset of the default settings. For example, here are the default \\nvalues for the opt-level  setting for the dev and release  profiles:\\n[profile.dev]\\nopt-level = 0\\n[profile.release]\\nopt-level = 3\\nThe opt-level  setting controls the number of optimizations Rust will \\napply to your code, with a range of 0 to 3. Applying more optimizations \\nextends compiling time, so if you’re in development and compiling your code often, you’ll want faster compiling even if the resulting code runs slower. That is the reason the default \\nopt-level  for dev is 0. When you’re \\nready to release your code, it’s best to spend more time compiling. You’ll only compile in release mode once, but you’ll run the compiled program many times, so release mode trades longer compile time for code that runs faster. That’s why the default \\nopt-level  for the release  profile is 3.\\nYou can override any default setting by adding a different value for it in \\nCargo.toml . For example, if we want to use optimization level 1 in the devel -\\nopment profile, we can add these two lines to our project’s Cargo.toml  file:\\n[profile.dev]\\nopt-level = 1\\nThis code overrides the default setting of 0. Now when we run cargo \\nbuild , Cargo will use the defaults for the dev profile plus our customization Cargo.toml\\nCargo.toml\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Use them to explain the overall purpose of the con -\\ntainer to help your users understand the crate’s organization.\\nExporting a Convenient Public API with pub use\\nIn Chapter 7, we covered how to organize our code into modules using the \\nmod keyword, how to make items public using the pub keyword, and how to \\nbring items into a scope using the use keyword. However, the structure that \\nmakes sense to you while you’re developing a crate might not be very conve -\\nnient for your users. You might want to organize your structs in a hierarchy \\ncontaining multiple levels, but then people who want to use a type you’ve defined deep in the hierarchy could have trouble finding out that type exists. They might also be annoyed at having to enter \\nuse my_crate::some  \\n_module::another_module::UsefulType;  rather than use my_crate::UsefulType; . \\nThe structure of your public API is a major consideration when publish -\\ning a crate. People who use your crate are less familiar with the structure than you are and might have difficulty finding the pieces they want to use if your crate has a large module hierarchy.\\nThe good news is that if the structure isn’t  convenient for others to use \\nfrom another library, you don’t have to rearrange your internal organization: instead, you can re-export items to make a public structure that’s different from your private structure by using \\npub use . Re-exporting takes a public item \\nin one location and makes it public in another location, as if it were defined in the other location instead. \\nFor example, say we made a library named \\nart for modeling artistic \\nconcepts. Within this library are two modules: a kinds  module containing \\ntwo enums named PrimaryColor  and SecondaryColor  and a utils  module con -\\ntaining a function named mix, as shown in Listing 14-3.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

To do so, visit the home page at https://crates  \\n.io/ and log in via a GitHub account. (The GitHub account is currently a \\nrequirement, but the site might support other ways of creating an account in the future.) Once you’re logged in, visit your account settings at https://crates.io/me/  and retrieve your API key. Then run the \\ncargo login  command \\nwith your API key, like this:\\n$ cargo login abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345\\nThis command will inform Cargo of your API token and store it locally \\nin ~/.cargo/credentials . Note that this token is a secret : do not share it with any -\\none else. If you do share it with anyone for any reason, you should revoke it and generate a new token on https://crates.io/ .\\nAdding Metadata to a New Crate\\nNow that you have an account, let’s say you have a crate you want to publish. Before publishing, you’ll need to add some metadata to your crate by adding it to the \\n[package]  section of the crate’s Cargo.toml  file. \\nYour crate will need a unique name. While you’re working on a crate \\nlocally, you can name a crate whatever you’d like. However, crate names on https://crates.io/  are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Once a crate \\nname is taken, no one else can publish a crate with that name. Search for the name you want to use on the site to find out whether it has been used.

In such situations, Cargo supports yanking  a crate version.\\nYanking a version prevents new projects from starting to depend on \\nthat version while allowing all existing projects that depend on it to con -\\ntinue to download and depend on that version. Essentially, a yank means that all projects with a Cargo.lock  will not break, and any future Cargo.lock  \\nfiles generated will not use the yanked version.\\nTo yank a version of a crate, run \\ncargo yank  and specify which version \\nyou want to yank:\\n$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1\\nBy adding --undo  to the command, you can also undo a yank and allow \\nprojects to start depending on a version again:\\n$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1 --undo\\nA yank does not  delete any code.

As your project develops, you might find that the library crate continues to get bigger and you want to split up your package further into multiple library crates. In this situation, Cargo offers a feature called workspaces  that \\ncan help manage multiple related packages that are developed in tandem.\\nCreating a Workspace\\nA workspace is a set of packages that share the same Cargo.lock  and output \\ndirectory. Let’s make a project using a workspace—we’ll use trivial code so we can concentrate on the structure of the workspace. There are multiple ways to structure a workspace; we’re going to show one common way. We’ll have a workspace containing a binary and two libraries. The binary, which will provide the main functionality, will depend on the two libraries. One library will provide an \\nadd_one  function, and a second library an add_two  \\nfunction. These three crates will be part of the same workspace. We’ll start by creating a new directory for the workspace:\\n$ mkdir add\\n$ cd add\\nNext, in the add  directory, we create the Cargo.toml  file that will con -\\nfigure the entire workspace. This file won’t have a [package]  section or the \\nmetadata we’ve seen in other Cargo.toml  files. Instead, it will start with a \\n[workspace]  section that will allow us to add members to the workspace by \\nspecifying the path to our binary crate; in this case, that path is adder :\\n[workspace]\\nmembers = [\\n    \"adder\",\\n]\\nNext, we’ll create the adder  binary crate by running cargo new  within the \\nadd directory:\\n$ cargo new --bin adder\\n     Created binary (application) `adder` project\\nAt this point, we can build the workspace by running cargo build . The \\nfiles in your add  directory should look like this:\\n├── Cargo.lock\\n├── Cargo.toml\\n├── adder\\n│   ├── Cargo.toml\\n│   └── src\\n│       └── main.rs\\n└── targetCargo.toml\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

If each crate had its own target  directory, each crate would have to recompile each of the other \\ncrates in the workspace to have the artifacts in its own target  directory. By \\nsharing one target  directory, the crates can avoid unnecessary rebuilding. \\nCreating the Second Crate in the Workspace\\nNext, let’s create another member crate in the workspace and call it add-one . \\nChange the top-level Cargo.toml  to specify the add-one  path in the members  list:\\n[workspace]\\nmembers = [\\n    \"adder\",\\n    \"add-one\",\\n]\\nThen generate a new library crate named add-one :\\n$ cargo new add-one --lib     Created library `add-one` project\\nYour add  directory should now have these directories and files:\\n├── Cargo.lock\\n├── Cargo.toml\\n├── add-one\\n│   ├── Cargo.toml\\n│   └── src\\n│       └── lib.rs\\n├── adder\\n│   ├── Cargo.toml\\n│   └── src\\n│       └── main.rs\\n└── target\\nIn the add-one/src/lib.rs  file, let’s add an add_one  function:\\npub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {    x + 1\\n}\\nNow that we have a library crate in the workspace, we can have the \\nbinary crate adder  depend on the library crate add-one .

This \\naddress refers to, or “points at,” some other \\ndata. The most common kind of pointer in Rust \\nis a reference, which you learned about in Chapter 4. \\nReferences are indicated by the & symbol and borrow \\nthe value they point to. They don’t have any special \\ncapabilities other than referring to data. Also, they \\ndon’t have any overhead and are the kind of pointer \\nwe use most often.\\nSmart pointers , on the other hand, are data structures that not only act \\nlike a pointer but also have additional metadata and capabilities.

One example that we’ll explore in this chapter is the refer -\\nence counting  smart pointer type. This pointer enables you to have multiple \\nowners of data by keeping track of the number of owners and, when no \\nowners remain, cleaning up the data.\\nIn Rust, which uses the concept of ownership and borrowing, an \\nadditional difference between references and smart pointers is that refer -\\nences are pointers that only borrow data; in contrast, in many cases, smart pointers own  the data they point to.\\nWe’ve already encountered a few smart pointers in this book, such as \\nString  and Vec<T>  in Chapter 8, although we didn’t call them smart pointers at \\nthe time. Both these types count as smart pointers because they own some memory and allow you to manipulate it. They also have metadata (such as their capacity) and extra capabilities or guarantees (such as with \\nString  \\nensuring its data will always be valid UTF-8).\\nSmart pointers are usually implemented using structs. The charac -\\nteristic that distinguishes a smart pointer from an ordinary struct is that smart pointers implement the \\nDeref  and Drop traits. The Deref  trait allows \\nan instance of the smart pointer struct to behave like a reference so you can write code that works with either references or smart pointers. The \\nDrop trait allows you to customize the code that is run when an instance \\nof the smart pointer goes out of scope. In this chapter, we’ll discuss both traits and demonstrate why they’re important to smart pointers.\\nGiven that the smart pointer pattern is a general design pattern used \\nfrequently in Rust, this chapter won’t cover every existing smart pointer. Many libraries have their own smart pointers, and you can even write your own. We’ll cover the most common smart pointers in the standard library:\\n•\\t\\nBox<T>  for allocating values on the heap\\n•\\tRc<T> , a reference counting type that enables multiple ownership\\n•\\tRef<T>  and RefMut<T> , accessed through RefCell<T> , a type that enforces \\nthe borrowing rules at runtime instead of compile timeIn addition, we’ll cover the interior mutability pattern where an immutable \\ntype exposes an API for mutating an interior value. We’ll also discuss reference \\ncycles : how they can leak memory and how to prevent them.\\nLet’s dive in!\\nUsing Box<T> to Point to Data on the Heap\\nThe most straightforward smart pointer is a box , whose type is written \\nBox<T> . Boxes allow you to store data on the heap rather than the stack. \\nWhat remains on the stack is the pointer to the heap data. Refer to Chapter 4 to review the difference between the stack and the heap. \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

In the second case, transferring ownership of a \\nlarge amount of data can take a long time because the data is copied around on the stack. To improve performance in this situation, we can store the large amount of data on the heap in a box. Then, only the small amount of pointer data is copied around on the stack, while the data it references stays in one place on the heap. The third case is known as a trait object , and \\nChapter 17 devotes an entire section (“Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types” on page 369) just to that topic. So what you learn here you’ll apply again in Chapter 17!\\nUsing a Box<T> to Store Data on the Heap\\nBefore we discuss this use case for Box<T> , we’ll cover the syntax and how to \\ninteract with values stored within a Box<T> .\\nListing 15-1 shows how to use a box to store an i32 value on the heap.\\nfn main() {\\n    let b = Box::new(5);\\n    println!(\"b = {}\", b);\\n}\\nListing 15-1: Storing an i32 value on the heap using a box\\nWe define the variable b to have the value of a Box that points to the \\nvalue 5, which is allocated on the heap. This program will print b = 5 ; in \\nthis case, we can access the data in the box similar to how we would if this \\ndata were on the stack. Just like any owned value, when a box goes out of scope, as \\nb does at the end of main, it will be deallocated. The deallocation \\nhappens for the box (stored on the stack) and the data it points to (stored on the heap).\\nPutting a single value on the heap isn’t very useful, so you won’t use \\nboxes by themselves in this way very often. Having values like a single \\ni32 \\non the stack, where they’re stored by default, is more appropriate in the majority of situations.

One \\ntype whose size can’t be known at compile time is a recursive type , where a \\nvalue can have as part of itself another value of the same type. Because this nesting of values could theoretically continue infinitely, Rust doesn’t know how much space a value of a recursive type needs. However, boxes have a known size, so by inserting a box in a recursive type definition, you can have recursive types.\\nLet’s explore the cons list , which is a data type common in functional \\nprogramming languages, as an example of a recursive type. The cons list type we’ll define is straightforward except for the recursion; therefore, the concepts in the example we’ll work with will be useful any time you get into more complex situations involving recursive types.\\nMore Information About the Cons List\\nA cons list  is a data structure that comes from the Lisp programming lan -\\nguage and its dialects. In Lisp, the \\ncons function (short for “construct func -\\ntion”) constructs a new pair from its two arguments, which usually are a \\nsingle value and another pair. These pairs containing pairs form a list.\\nThe cons function concept has made its way into more general functional \\nprogramming jargon: “to cons x onto y ” informally means to construct a new \\ncontainer instance by putting the element x at the start of this new container, followed by the container y .\\nEach item in a cons list contains two elements: the value of the current \\nitem and the next item. The last item in the list contains only a value called \\nNil without a next item. A cons list is produced by recursively calling the cons \\nfunction. The canonical name to denote the base case of the recursion is \\nNil. Note that this is not the same as the “null” concept in Chapter 6, which is \\nan invalid or absent value.\\nAlthough functional programming languages use cons lists frequently, \\nthe cons list isn’t a commonly used data structure in Rust. Most of the time when you have a list of items in Rust, \\nVec<T>  is a better choice. Other, more \\ncomplex recursive data types are  useful in various situations, but by starting \\nwith the cons list, we can explore how boxes let us define a recursive data type without much distraction.\\nListing 15-2 contains an enum definition for a cons list. Note that this \\ncode won’t compile yet because the \\nList type doesn’t have a known size, \\nwhich we’ll demonstrate.\\nenum List {\\n    Cons(i32, List),\\n    Nil,\\n}\\nListing 15-2: The first attempt at defining an enum to represent a cons list data structure of \\ni32 valuessrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

As a result, Rust can’t figure out how much space it needs to store a \\nList value. Let’s break down why we get this error a bit. First, let’s look at how \\nRust decides how much space it needs to store a value of a non-recursive type.\\nComputing the Size of a Non-Recursive Type\\nRecall the Message  enum we defined in Listing 6-2 when we discussed enum \\ndefinitions in Chapter 6:\\nenum Message {\\n    Quit,\\n    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },\\n    Write(String),\\n    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),\\n}src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Rust \\nsees that Message::Quit  doesn’t need any space, Message::Move  needs enough \\nspace to store two i32 values, and so forth. Because only one variant will be \\nused, the most space a Message  value will need is the space it would take to \\nstore the largest of its variants.\\nContrast this with what happens when Rust tries to determine how \\nmuch space a recursive type like the List enum in Listing 15-2 needs. The \\ncompiler starts by looking at the Cons \\nvariant, which holds a value of type i32 \\nand a value of type List. Therefore, Cons \\nneeds an amount of space equal to the size of an \\ni32 plus the size of a List. To \\nfigure out how much memory the List \\ntype needs, the compiler looks at the variants, starting with the \\nCons variant. \\nThe Cons variant holds a value of type \\ni32 and a value of type List, and this \\nprocess continues infinitely, as shown in Figure 15-1.\\nUsing Box<T> to Get a Recursive Type with a Known Size\\nRust can’t figure out how much space to allocate for recursively defined \\ntypes, so the compiler gives the error in Listing 15-4. But the error does include this helpful suggestion:\\n  = help: insert indirection (e.g., a `Box`, `Rc`, or `&`) at some point to\\n  make `List` representable\\nIn this suggestion, indirection  means that instead of storing a value \\ndirectly, we’ll change the data structure to store the value indirectly by \\nstoring a pointer to the value instead.\\nBecause a Box<T>  is a pointer, Rust always knows how much space a \\nBox<T>  needs: a pointer’s size doesn’t change based on the amount of data \\nit’s pointing to. This means we can put a Box<T>  inside the Cons variant \\ninstead of another List value directly. The Box<T>  will point to the next \\nList value that will be on the heap rather than inside the Cons variant. \\nConceptually, we still have a list, created with lists “holding” other lists, but this implementation is now more like placing the items next to one another rather than inside one another.\\nWe can change the definition of the \\nList enum in Listing 15-2 and \\nthe usage of the List in Listing 15-3 to the code in Listing 15-5, which will \\ncompile.\\nenum List {\\n    Cons(i32, Box<List>),\\n    Nil,\\n}ConsCons\\nConsCons\\nCons\\ni32∞i32i32i32i32\\nFigure 15-1: An infinite List consist -\\ning of infinite Cons variants\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Deref coercion makes it possible to call hello  \\nwith a reference to a value of type MyBox<String> , as shown in Listing 15-12.\\nfn main() {\\n    let m = MyBox::new(String::from(\"Rust\"));\\n    hello(&m);\\n}\\nListing 15-12: Calling hello  with a reference to a MyBox<String>  value, which works \\nbecause of deref coercion\\nHere we’re calling the hello  function with the argument &m, which is a \\nreference to a MyBox<String>  value. Because we implemented the Deref  trait \\non MyBox<T>  in Listing 15-10, Rust can turn &MyBox<String>  into &String  by \\ncalling deref . The standard library provides an implementation of Deref  on src/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Rust calls deref  again to turn the &String  into &str, which matches the \\nhello  function’s definition.\\nIf Rust didn’t implement deref coercion, we would have to write the code \\nin Listing 15-13 instead of the code in Listing 15-12 to call hello  with a value \\nof type &MyBox<String> .\\nfn main() {\\n    let m = MyBox::new(String::from(\"Rust\"));\\n    hello(&(*m)[..]);\\n}\\nListing 15-13: The code we would have to write if Rust didn’t have deref coercion\\nThe (*m) dereferences the MyBox<String>  into a String . Then the & and [..] \\ntake a string slice of the String  that is equal to the whole string to match the \\nsignature of hello . The code without deref coercions is harder to read, write, \\nand understand with all of these symbols involved. Deref coercion allows Rust \\nto handle these conversions for us automatically.\\nWhen the Deref  trait is defined for the types involved, Rust will analyze \\nthe types and use Deref::deref  as many times as necessary to get a reference to \\nmatch the parameter’s type. The number of times that Deref::deref  needs to \\nbe inserted is resolved at compile time, so there is no runtime penalty for tak -\\ning advantage of deref coercion!\\nHow Deref Coercion Interacts with Mutability\\nSimilar to how you use the Deref  trait to override the * operator on immu -\\ntable references, you can use the DerefMut  trait to override the * operator \\non mutable references.\\nRust does deref coercion when it finds types and trait implementations \\nin three cases:\\n•\\tFrom &T to &U when T: Deref<Target=U>\\n•\\tFrom &mut T  to &mut U  when T: DerefMut<Target=U>\\n•\\tFrom &mut T  to &U when T: Deref<Target=U>\\nThe first two cases are the same except for mutability. The first case \\nstates that if you have a &T, and T implements Deref  to some type U, you can \\nget a &U transparently. The second case states that the same deref coercion \\nhappens for mutable references.\\nThe third case is trickier: Rust will also coerce a mutable reference to \\nan immutable one. But the reverse is not  possible: immutable references will \\nnever coerce to mutable references. Because of the borrowing rules, if you \\nhave a mutable reference, that mutable reference must be the only refer -\\nence to that data (otherwise, the program wouldn’t compile). Converting one mutable reference to one immutable reference will never break the bor -\\nrowing rules. Converting an immutable reference to a mutable reference would require that there is only one immutable reference to that data, and src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Therefore, Rust can’t make the \\nassumption that converting an immutable reference to a mutable reference is possible.\\nRunning Code on Cleanup with the Drop Trait\\nThe second trait important to the smart pointer pattern is Drop, which lets \\nyou customize what happens when a value is about to go out of scope. You can provide an implementation for the \\nDrop trait on any type, and the code \\nyou specify can be used to release resources like files or network connec -\\ntions. We’re introducing Drop in the context of smart pointers because the \\nfunctionality of the Drop trait is almost always used when implementing a \\nsmart pointer. For example, Box<T>  customizes Drop to deallocate the space \\non the heap that the box points to.\\nIn some languages, the programmer must call code to free memory \\nor resources every time they finish using an instance of a smart pointer. If they forget, the system might become overloaded and crash. In Rust, you can specify that a particular bit of code be run whenever a value goes out of scope, and the compiler will insert this code automatically. As a result, you don’t need to be careful about placing cleanup code everywhere in a pro -\\ngram that an instance of a particular type is finished with—you still won’t leak resources!\\nSpecify the code to run when a value goes out of scope by implementing \\nthe \\nDrop trait. The Drop trait requires you to implement one method named \\ndrop that takes a mutable reference to self. To see when Rust calls drop, let’s \\nimplement drop with println!  statements for now.\\nListing 15-14 shows a CustomSmartPointer  struct whose only custom func -\\ntionality is that it will print Dropping CustomSmartPointer!  when the instance \\ngoes out of scope. This example demonstrates when Rust runs the drop \\nfunction.\\nstruct CustomSmartPointer {\\n    data: String,\\n}\\n\\uf075 impl Drop for CustomSmartPointer {\\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\\n        \\uf076 println!(\"Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `{}`!\", self.data);\\n    }\\n}\\nfn main() {\\n    \\uf077 let c = CustomSmartPointer { data: String::from(\"my stuff\") };\\n    \\uf078 let d = CustomSmartPointer { data: String::from(\"other stuff\") };    \\uf079 println!(\"CustomSmartPointers created.\");\\uf07a }\\nListing 15-14: A \\nCustomSmartPointer  struct that implements the Drop trait where we would \\nput our cleanup codesrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The body of the drop \\nfunction is where you would place any logic that you wanted to run when \\nan instance of your type goes out of scope. We’re printing some text here to demonstrate when Rust will call \\ndrop.\\nIn main, we create two instances of CustomSmartPointer  \\uf077\\uf078 and then \\nprint CustomSmartPointers created.  \\uf079. At the end of main \\uf07a, our instances of \\nCustomSmartPointer  will go out of scope, and Rust will call the code we put in \\nthe drop method \\uf076 , printing our final message. Note that we didn’t need to \\ncall the drop method explicitly.\\nWhen we run this program, we’ll see the following output:\\nCustomSmartPointers created.\\nDropping CustomSmartPointer with data `other stuff`!\\nDropping CustomSmartPointer with data `my stuff`!\\nRust automatically called drop for us when our instances went out of \\nscope, calling the code we specified. Variables are dropped in the reverse \\norder of their creation, so d was dropped before c. This example gives you \\na visual guide to how the drop method works; usually you would specify the \\ncleanup code that your type needs to run rather than a print message.\\nDropping a Value Early with std::mem::drop\\nUnfortunately, it’s not straightforward to disable the automatic drop func -\\ntionality. Disabling drop isn’t usually necessary; the whole point of the Drop \\ntrait is that it’s taken care of automatically. Occasionally, however, you might want to clean up a value early. One example is when using smart pointers that manage locks: you might want to force the \\ndrop method that releases \\nthe lock to run so other code in the same scope can acquire the lock. Rust doesn’t let you call the \\nDrop trait’s drop method manually; instead you have \\nto call the std::mem::drop  function provided by the standard library if you \\nwant to force a value to be dropped before the end of its scope.\\nIf we try to call the Drop trait’s drop method manually by modifying the \\nmain function in Listing 15-14, as shown in Listing 15-15, we’ll get a com -\\npiler error.\\nfn main() {\\n    let c = CustomSmartPointer { data: String::from(\"some data\") };\\n    println!(\"CustomSmartPointer created.\");\\n    c.drop();\\n    println!(\"CustomSmartPointer dropped before the end of main.\");\\n}\\nListing 15-15: Attempting to call the drop method from the Drop trait manually to clean up \\nearlysrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

However, there are cases when a single value might have multiple owners. For example, in graph data structures, multiple edges might point to the same node, and that node is conceptually owned by all of the edges that point to it. A node shouldn’t be cleaned up unless it doesn’t have any edges pointing to it.\\nTo enable multiple ownership, Rust has a type called \\nRc<T> , which is an \\nabbreviation for reference counting . The Rc<T>  type keeps track of the number \\nof references to a value, which determines whether or not a value is still in use. If there are zero references to a value, the value can be cleaned up without any references becoming invalid.\\nImagine \\nRc<T>  as a TV in a family room. When one person enters to \\nwatch TV, they turn it on. Others can come into the room and watch the TV. When the last person leaves the room, they turn off the TV because it’s no longer being used. If someone turns off the TV while others are still watching it, there would be uproar from the remaining TV watchers!\\nWe use the \\nRc<T>  type when we want to allocate some data on the heap \\nfor multiple parts of our program to read and we can’t determine at compile time which part will finish using the data last. If we knew which part would finish last, we could just make that part the data’s owner, and the normal ownership rules enforced at compile time would take effect.\\nNote that \\nRc<T>  is only for use in single-threaded scenarios. When we \\ndiscuss concurrency in Chapter 16, we’ll cover how to do reference count -\\ning in multithreaded programs.\\nUsing Rc<T> to Share Data\\nLet’s return to our cons list example in Listing 15-5. Recall that we defined it using \\nBox<T> . This time, we’ll create two lists that share ownership of a \\nthird list. Conceptually, this looks similar to Figure 15-3.\\n b 3\\nc 4a 5 10 Nil\\nFigure 15-3: Two lists, b and c, sharing ownership of  \\na third list, a\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

To mutate data, the pattern uses \\nunsafe  \\ncode inside a data structure to bend Rust’s usual rules that govern mutation and borrowing. We haven’t yet covered unsafe code; we will in Chapter 19. We can use types that use the interior mutability pattern when we can ensure that the borrowing rules will be followed at runtime, even though the com -\\npiler can’t guarantee that. The \\nunsafe  code involved is then wrapped in a safe \\nAPI, and the outer type is still immutable.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

So, what makes RefCell<T>  different from a type like Box<T> ? Recall the \\nborrowing rules you learned in Chapter 4:\\n•\\tAt any given time, you can have either  but not both of the following: one \\nmutable reference or any number of immutable references.\\n•\\tReferences must always be valid.With references and \\nBox<T> , the borrowing rules’ invariants are enforced \\nat compile time. With RefCell<T> , these invariants are enforced at runtime . \\nWith references, if you break these rules, you’ll get a compiler error. With \\nRefCell<T> , if you break these rules, your program will panic and exit.\\nThe advantages of checking the borrowing rules at compile time are \\nthat errors will be caught sooner in the development process, and there is no \\nimpact on runtime performance because all the analysis is completed before -\\nhand. For those reasons, checking the borrowing rules at compile time is the best choice in the majority of cases, which is why this is Rust’s default.\\nThe advantage of checking the borrowing rules at runtime instead is \\nthat certain memory-safe scenarios are then allowed, whereas they are disal -\\nlowed by the compile-time checks. Static analysis, like the Rust compiler, is inherently conservative. Some properties of code are impossible to detect by analyzing the code: the most famous example is the Halting Problem, which is beyond the scope of this book but is an interesting topic to research.\\nBecause some analysis is impossible, if the Rust compiler can’t be sure \\nthe code complies with the ownership rules, it might reject a correct pro -\\ngram; in this way, it’s conservative. If Rust accepted an incorrect program, users wouldn’t be able to trust in the guarantees Rust makes. However, if Rust rejects a correct program, the programmer will be inconvenienced, but nothing catastrophic can occur.

Using \\nRefCell<T>  is one way to get the ability to have interior mutability. But \\nRefCell<T>  doesn’t get around the borrowing rules completely: the borrow \\nchecker in the compiler allows this interior mutability, and the borrowing rules are checked at runtime instead. If you violate the rules, you’ll get a \\npanic!  instead of a compiler error.\\nLet’s work through a practical example where we can use RefCell<T>  to \\nmutate an immutable value and see why that is useful.\\nA Use Case for Interior Mutability: Mock Objects\\nA test double  is the general programming concept for a type used in place of \\nanother type during testing.

With RefCell<T> , we use the borrow  and borrow_mut  methods, \\nwhich are part of the safe API that belongs to RefCell<T> . The borrow  method \\nreturns the smart pointer type Ref<T> , and borrow_mut  returns the smart \\npointer type RefMut<T> . Both types implement Deref , so we can treat them like \\nregular references.\\nThe RefCell<T>  keeps track of how many Ref<T>  and RefMut<T>  smart \\npointers are currently active. Every time we call borrow , the RefCell<T>  \\nincreases its count of how many immutable borrows are active. When a \\nRef<T>  value goes out of scope, the count of immutable borrows goes down \\nby one. Just like the compile-time borrowing rules, RefCell<T>  lets us have \\nmany immutable borrows or one mutable borrow at any point in time.\\nIf we try to violate these rules, rather than getting a compiler error as \\nwe would with references, the implementation of RefCell<T>  will panic at \\nruntime. Listing 15-23 shows a modification of the implementation of send \\nin Listing 15-22. We’re deliberately trying to create two mutable borrows \\nactive for the same scope to illustrate that RefCell<T>  prevents us from doing \\nthis at runtime.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Then we create another mutable borrow in the same way \\nin the variable two_borrow . This makes two mutable references in the same \\nscope, which isn’t allowed. When we run the tests for our library, the code \\nin Listing 15-23 will compile without any errors, but the test will fail:\\n---- tests::it_sends_an_over_75_percent_warning_message stdout ----\\n        thread 'tests::it_sends_an_over_75_percent_warning_message' panicked \\nat 'already borrowed: BorrowMutError', src/libcore/result.rs:906:4\\nnote: Run with 'RUST_BACKTRACE=1' for a backtrace.\\nNotice that the code panicked with the message already borrowed: \\nBorrowMutError . This is how RefCell<T>  handles violations of the borrowing \\nrules at runtime.\\nCatching borrowing errors at runtime rather than compile time means \\nthat you would find a mistake in your code later in the development process \\nand possibly not until your code was deployed to production. Also, your code would incur a small runtime performance penalty as a result of keeping track of the borrows at runtime rather than compile time. However, using \\nRefCell<T>  makes it possible to write a mock object that can modify itself to \\nkeep track of the messages it has seen while you’re using it in a context where only immutable values are allowed. You can use \\nRefCell<T>  despite its trade-\\noffs to get more functionality than regular references provide.\\nHaving Multiple Owners of Mutable Data by Combining Rc<T> and \\nRefCell<T>\\nA common way to use RefCell<T>  is in combination with Rc<T> . Recall that \\nRc<T>  lets you have multiple owners of some data, but it only gives immutable \\naccess to that data. If you have an Rc<T>  that holds a RefCell<T> , you can get a \\nvalue that can have multiple owners and  that you can mutate!\\nFor example, recall the cons list example in Listing 15-18 where we used \\nRc<T>  to allow multiple lists to share ownership of another list. Because Rc<T>  \\nholds only immutable values, we can’t change any of the values in the list \\nonce we’ve created them. Let’s add in RefCell<T>  to gain the ability to change \\nthe values in the lists.

Preventing memory leaks entirely is not one of Rust’s guarantees \\nin the same way that disallowing data races at compile time is, meaning memory leaks are memory safe in Rust. We can see that Rust allows memory leaks by using \\nRc<T>  and RefCell<T> : it’s possible to create references where \\nitems refer to each other in a cycle. This creates memory leaks because the reference count of each item in the cycle will never reach 0, and the values will never be dropped.\\nCreating a Reference Cycle\\nLet’s look at how a reference cycle might happen and how to prevent it, start -\\ning with the definition of the List enum and a tail method in Listing 15-25.\\nuse std::rc::Rc;\\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\\nuse List::{Cons, Nil};\\n#[derive(Debug)]\\nenum List {\\n    \\uf075 Cons(i32, RefCell<Rc<List>>),\\n    Nil,}\\nimpl List {\\n    \\uf076 fn tail(&self) -> Option<&RefCell<Rc<List>>> {\\n        match *self {\\n            Cons(_, ref item) => Some(item),\\n            Nil => None,\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\nListing 15-25: A cons list definition that holds a \\nRefCell<T>  so we can modify what a Cons \\nvariant is referring to\\nWe’re using another variation of the List definition in Listing 15-5.

In Listing 15-25, we always want \\nCons variants to own their list, so reorganizing the data structure \\nisn’t possible. Let’s look at an example using graphs made up of parent nodes and child nodes to see when non-ownership relationships are an appropriate way to prevent reference cycles.\\nPreventing Reference Cycles: Turning an Rc<T> into a Weak<T>\\nSo far, we’ve demonstrated that calling Rc::clone  increases the strong_count  \\nof an Rc<T>  instance, and an Rc<T>  instance is only cleaned up if its strong_count  \\nis 0. You can also create a weak reference  to the value within an Rc<T>  instance \\nby calling Rc::downgrade  and passing a reference to the Rc<T> .

They won’t cause \\na reference cycle because any cycle involving some weak references will be broken once the strong reference count of values involved is 0.\\nBecause the value that \\nWeak<T>  references might have been dropped, \\nto do anything with the value that a Weak<T>  is pointing to, you must make \\nsure the value still exists. Do this by calling the upgrade  method on a Weak<T>  \\ninstance, which will return an Option<Rc<T>> .

We can get from branch  to \\nleaf through branch.children , but there’s no way to get from leaf to branch . \\nThe reason is that leaf has no reference to branch  and doesn’t know they’re \\nrelated. We want leaf to know that branch  is its parent. We’ll do that next.\\nAdding a Reference from a Child to Its Parent\\nTo make the child node aware of its parent, we need to add a parent  field to \\nour Node struct definition. The trouble is in deciding what the type of parent  \\nshould be. We know it can’t contain an Rc<T> , because that would create a ref -\\nerence cycle with leaf.parent  pointing to branch  and branch.children  pointing \\nto leaf, which would cause their strong_count  values to never be 0.\\nThinking about the relationships another way, a parent node should own \\nits children: if a parent node is dropped, its child nodes should be dropped as \\nwell. However, a child should not own its parent: if we drop a child node, the parent should still exist. This is a case for weak references!\\nSo instead of \\nRc<T> , we’ll make the type of parent  use Weak<T> , specifically \\na RefCell<Weak<Node>> . Now our Node struct definition looks like this:\\nuse std::rc::{Rc, Weak};\\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\\n#[derive(Debug)]\\nstruct Node {\\n    value: i32,    parent: RefCell<Weak<Node>>,\\n    children: RefCell<Vec<Rc<Node>>>,\\n}\\nA node will be able to refer to its parent node but doesn’t own its par -\\nent. In Listing 15-28, we update main to use this new definition so the leaf \\nnode will have a way to refer to its parent, branch .\\nfn main() {    let leaf = Rc::new(Node {\\n        value: 3,\\n        \\uf075 parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),\\n        children: RefCell::new(vec![]),\\n    });\\n    \\uf076 println!(\"leaf parent = {:?}\", leaf.parent.borrow().upgrade());\\n    let branch = Rc::new(Node {        value: 5,src/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

We see this in the output from the \\nfirst println!  statement \\uf076 :\\nleaf parent = None\\nWhen we create the branch  node, it will also have a new Weak<Node>  refer -\\nence in the parent  field \\uf077 , because branch  doesn’t have a parent node. We still \\nhave leaf as one of the children of branch . Once we have the Node instance in \\nbranch , we can modify leaf to give it a Weak<Node>  reference to its parent \\uf078 . We \\nuse the borrow_mut  method on the RefCell<Weak<Node>>  in the parent  field of leaf, \\nand then we use the Rc::downgrade  function to create a Weak<Node>  reference to \\nbranch  from the Rc<Node>  in branch .\\nWhen we print the parent of leaf again \\uf079 , this time we’ll get a Some vari-\\nant holding branch : now leaf can access its parent! When we print leaf, we \\nalso avoid the cycle that eventually ended in a stack overflow like we had in \\nListing 15-26; the Weak<Node>  references are printed as (Weak) :\\nleaf parent = Some(Node { value: 5, parent: RefCell { value: (Weak) },\\nchildren: RefCell { value: [Node { value: 3, parent: RefCell { value: (Weak) \\n}, children: RefCell { value: [] } }] } })\\nThe lack of infinite output indicates that this code didn’t create a refer -\\nence cycle. We can also tell this by looking at the values we get from calling \\nRc::strong_count  and Rc::weak_count .\\nVisualizing Changes to strong_count and weak_count\\nLet’s look at how the strong_count  and weak_count  values of the Rc<Node>  \\ninstances change by creating a new inner scope and moving the creation \\nof branch  into that scope. By doing so, we can see what happens when \\nbranch  is created and then dropped when it goes out of scope.

Fearless \\nconcurrency allows you to write code that is free of subtle bugs and is easy to refactor without introducing new bugs. \\nnote  For simplicity’s sake, we’ll refer to many of the problems as concurrent  rather than \\nbeing more precise by saying concurrent and/or parallel . If this book were about \\nconcurrency and/or parallelism, we’d be more specific. For this chapter, please men -\\ntally substitute concurrent and/or parallel whenever we use concurrent .\\nMany languages are dogmatic about the solutions they offer for handling \\nconcurrent problems. For example, Erlang has elegant functionality for message-passing concurrency but has only obscure ways to share state between threads. Supporting only a subset of possible solutions is a reason -\\nable strategy for higher-level languages, because a higher-level language promises benefits from giving up some control to gain abstractions. However, lower-level languages are expected to provide the solution with the best performance in any given situation and have fewer abstractions over the hardware.

Within your program, you can also have independent parts that run simultaneously.

Many \\noperating systems provide an API for creating new threads. This model where a language calls the operating system APIs to create threads is sometimes called 1:1 , meaning one operating system thread per one language thread.\\nMany programming languages provide their own special implementa -\\ntion of threads. Programming language–provided threads are known as green  \\nthreads, and languages that use these green threads will execute them in the context of a different number of operating system threads. For this reason, the green-threaded model is called the M:N  model: there are \\nM green threads \\nper N operating system threads, where M and N are not necessarily the same \\nnumber.\\nEach model has its own advantages and trade-offs, and the trade-off \\nmost important to Rust is runtime support. Runtime  is a confusing term and \\ncan have different meanings in different contexts. \\nIn this context, by runtime  we mean code that is included by the language \\nin every binary. This code can be large or small depending on the language, but every non-assembly language will have some amount of runtime code. For that reason, colloquially when people say a language has “no runtime,” they often mean “small runtime.” Smaller runtimes have fewer features but have the advantage of resulting in smaller binaries, which make it easier to combine the language with other languages in more contexts. Although many languages are okay with increasing the runtime size in exchange for more features, Rust needs to have nearly no runtime and cannot compromise on being able to call into C to maintain performance.\\nThe green-threading M:N model requires a larger language runtime to \\nmanage threads. As such, the Rust standard library only provides an imple -\\nmentation of 1:1 threading. Because Rust is such a low-level language, there are crates that implement M:N threading if you would rather trade overhead for aspects such as more control over which threads run when and lower costs of context switching, for example.\\nNow that we’ve defined threads in Rust, let’s explore how to use the \\nthread-related API provided by the standard library.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

If you put something like \\na rubber duck or boat into a stream, it will travel downstream to the end of the waterway.\\nA channel in programming has two halves: a transmitter and a receiver. \\nThe transmitter half is the upstream location where you put rubber ducks into the river, and the receiver half is where the rubber duck ends up downstream. One part of your code calls methods on the transmitter with the data you want to send, and another part checks the receiving end for arriving messages. A channel is said to be closed  if either the transmitter or \\nreceiver half is dropped.\\nHere, we’ll work up to a program that has one thread to generate values \\nand send them down a channel, and another thread that will receive the values and print them. We’ll be sending simple values between threads using a channel to illustrate the feature. Once you’re familiar with the tech -\\nnique, you could use channels to implement a chat system or a system where many threads perform parts of a calculation and send the parts to one thread that aggregates the results.\\nFirst, in Listing 16-6, we’ll create a channel but not do anything with it. \\nNote that this won’t compile yet because Rust can’t tell what type of values we want to send over the channel.\\nuse std::sync::mpsc;\\nfn main() {\\n    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();\\n}\\nListing 16-6: Creating a channel and assigning the two halves to tx and rx\\nWe create a new channel using the mpsc::channel  function; mpsc stands \\nfor multiple producer, single consumer . In short, the way Rust’s standard library \\nimplements channels means a channel can have multiple sending  ends \\nthat produce values but only one receiving  end that consumes those values. \\nImagine multiple streams flowing together into one big river: everything sent \\ndown any of the streams will end up in one river at the end. We’ll start with a single producer for now, but we’ll add multiple producers when we get this example working.\\nThe \\nmpsc::channel  function returns a tuple, the first element of which \\nis the sending end and the second element the receiving end. The abbrevia -\\ntions tx and rx are traditionally used in many fields for transmitter  and receiver , \\nrespectively, so we name our variables as such to indicate each end. We’re using a \\nlet statement with a pattern that destructures the tuples; we’ll discuss \\nthe use of patterns in let statements and destructuring in Chapter 18. Using \\na let statement this way is a convenient approach to extract the pieces of the \\ntuple returned by mpsc::channel . \\nLet’s move the transmitting end into a spawned thread and have it send \\none string so the spawned thread is communicating with the main thread, as shown in Listing 16-7.

Rust’s type system and ownership rules \\ngreatly assist in getting this management correct. For an example, let’s look at mutexes, one of the more common concurrency primitives for shared memory.\\nUsing Mutexes to Allow Access to Data from One Thread at a Time\\nMutex  is an abbreviation for mutual exclusion , as in, a mutex allows only one \\nthread to access some data at any given time. To access the data in a mutex, a thread must first signal that it wants access by asking to acquire the mutex’s lock. The lock is a data structure that is part of the mutex that keeps track \\nof who currently has exclusive access to the data. Therefore, the mutex is described as guarding  the data it holds via the locking system.\\nMutexes have a reputation for being difficult to use because you have to \\nremember two rules:\\n•\\tYou must attempt to acquire the lock before using the data.\\n•\\tWhen you’re done with the data that the mutex guards, you must \\nunlock the data so other threads can acquire the lock.\\nFor a real-world metaphor for a mutex, imagine a panel discussion at \\na conference with only one microphone. Before a panelist can speak, they \\nhave to ask or signal that they want to use the microphone. When they get the microphone, they can talk for as long as they want and then hand the microphone to the next panelist who requests to speak. If a panelist forgets to hand the microphone off when they’re finished with it, no one else is able to speak. If management of the shared microphone goes wrong, the panel won’t work as planned!\\nManagement of mutexes can be incredibly tricky to get right, which is why \\nso many people are enthusiastic about channels. However, thanks to Rust’s type system and ownership rules, you can’t get locking and unlocking wrong.\\nThe API of Mutex<T>\\nAs an example of how to use a mutex, let’s start by using a mutex in a single-\\nthreaded context, as shown in Listing 16-12.\\nuse std::sync::Mutex;\\nfn main() {\\n    u let m = Mutex::new(5);\\n    {\\n        v let mut num = m.lock().unwrap();\\n        w *num = 6;\\n    x }\\n    y println!(\"m = {:?}\", m);\\n}\\nListing 16-12: Exploring the API of Mutex<T>  in a single-threaded context for simplicitysrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 386}, page_content='Fearless Concurrency    357As with many types, we create a Mutex<T>  using the associated func -\\ntion new u. To access the data inside the mutex, we use the lock method to \\nacquire the lock v . This call will block the current thread so it can’t do any \\nwork until it’s our turn to have the lock. \\nThe call to lock would fail if another thread holding the lock panicked. \\nIn that case, no one would ever be able to get the lock, so we’ve chosen to \\nuse unwrap  and have this thread panic if we’re in that situation. \\nAfter we’ve acquired the lock, we can treat the return value, named num \\nin this case, as a mutable reference to the data inside w . The type system \\nensures that we acquire a lock before using the value in m: Mutex<i32>  is not \\nan i32, so we must  acquire the lock to be able to use the i32 value. We can’t \\nforget; the type system won’t let us access the inner i32 otherwise.\\nAs you might suspect, Mutex<T>  is a smart pointer. More accurately, the \\ncall to lock returns  a smart pointer called MutexGuard . This smart pointer \\nimplements Deref  to point at our inner data; the smart pointer also has a \\nDrop implementation that releases the lock automatically when a MutexGuard  \\ngoes out of scope, which happens at the end of the inner scope x . As \\na result, we don’t risk forgetting to release the lock and blocking the mutex from being used by other threads because the lock release happens automatically.\\nAfter dropping the lock, we can print the mutex value and see that we \\nwere able to change the inner \\ni32 to 6 y .\\nSharing a Mutex<T> Between Multiple Threads\\nNow, let’s try to share a value between multiple threads using Mutex<T> .

We’ll talk about Send in the \\nnext section: it’s one of the traits that ensures the types we use with threads are meant for use in concurrent situations.\\nUnfortunately, \\nRc<T>  is not safe to share across threads. When Rc<T>  \\nmanages the reference count, it adds to the count for each call to clone  and \\nsubtracts from the count when each clone is dropped. But it doesn’t use any concurrency primitives to make sure that changes to the count can’t be inter -\\nrupted by another thread. This could lead to wrong counts—subtle bugs that could in turn lead to memory leaks or a value being dropped before we’re done with it. What we need is a type exactly like \\nRc<T>  but one that makes \\nchanges to the reference count in a thread-safe way.\\nAtomic Reference Counting with Arc<T>\\nFortunately, Arc<T>  is a type like Rc<T>  that is safe to use in concurrent situ -\\nations. The a stands for atomic , meaning it’s an atomically reference counted  \\ntype. Atomics are an additional kind of concurrency primitive that we \\nwon’t cover in detail here: see the standard library documentation for \\nstd::sync::atomic  for more details. At this point, you just need to know that \\natomics work like primitive types but are safe to share across threads.\\nYou might then wonder why all primitive types aren’t atomic and why \\nstandard library types aren’t implemented to use Arc<T>  by default. The rea -\\nson is that thread safety comes with a performance penalty that you only want to pay when you really need to. If you’re just performing operations on values within a single thread, your code can run faster if it doesn’t have to enforce the guarantees atomics provide.\\nLet’s return to our example: \\nArc<T>  and Rc<T>  have the same API, so we \\nfix our program by changing the use line, the call to new, and the call to \\nclone .

You could also \\nuse this program’s structure to do more complicated operations than just \\nincrementing a counter. Using this strategy, you can divide a calculation into independent parts, split those parts across threads, and then use a \\nMutex<T>  to have each thread update the final result with its part.\\nSimilarities Between  RefCell<T>/Rc<T>  and Mutex<T>/Arc<T>\\nYou might have noticed that counter  is immutable but we could get a mutable \\nreference to the value inside it; this means Mutex<T>  provides interior mutabil -\\nity, as the Cell family does. In the same way we used RefCell<T>  in Chapter 15 \\nto allow us to mutate contents inside an Rc<T> , we use Mutex<T>  to mutate con -\\ntents inside an Arc<T> .\\nAnother detail to note is that Rust can’t protect you from all kinds of \\nlogic errors when you use Mutex<T> . Recall in Chapter 15 that using Rc<T>  \\ncame with the risk of creating reference cycles, where two Rc<T>  values refer \\nto each other, causing memory leaks. Similarly, Mutex<T>  comes with the \\nrisk of creating deadlocks . These occur when an operation needs to lock two \\nresources and two threads have each acquired one of the locks, causing them to wait for each other forever. If you’re interested in deadlocks, try creating a Rust program that has a deadlock; then research deadlock miti -\\ngation strategies for mutexes in any language and have a go at implement -\\ning them in Rust. The standard library API documentation for \\nMutex<T>  and \\nMutexGuard  offers useful information. \\nWe’ll round out this chapter by talking about the Send and Sync traits \\nand how we can use them with custom types.\\nExtensible Concurrency with the Sync and Send Traits\\nInterestingly, the Rust language has very few concurrency features. Almost every concurrency feature we’ve talked about so far in this chapter has been part of the standard library, not the language.

Almost every Rust type is Send, but \\nthere are some exceptions, including Rc<T> : this cannot be Send because if you \\ncloned an Rc<T>  value and tried to transfer ownership of the clone to another \\nthread, both threads might update the reference count at the same time. \\nFor this reason, Rc<T>  is implemented for use in single-threaded situations \\nwhere you don’t want to pay the thread-safe performance penalty.\\nTherefore, Rust’s type system and trait bounds ensure that you can never \\naccidentally send an Rc<T>  value across threads unsafely.

Almost all primitive types are Send, aside from raw pointers, which \\nwe’ll discuss in Chapter 19.\\nAllowing Access from Multiple Threads with Sync\\nThe Sync marker trait indicates that it is safe for the type implementing Sync \\nto be referenced from multiple threads. In other words, any type T is Sync if &T \\n(a reference to T) is Send, meaning the reference can be sent safely to another \\nthread. Similar to Send, primitive types are Sync, and types composed entirely \\nof types that are Sync are also Sync.\\nThe smart pointer Rc<T>  is also not Sync for the same reasons that it’s \\nnot Send. The RefCell<T>  type (which we talked about in Chapter 15) and \\nthe family of related Cell<T>  types are not Sync. The implementation of \\nborrow checking that RefCell<T>  does at runtime is not thread-safe.

These evolve more quickly than the standard library, so be sure to search online for the current, state-of-the-art crates to use in multithreaded situations.\\nThe Rust standard library provides channels for message passing and \\nsmart pointer types, such as \\nMutex<T>  and Arc<T> , that are safe to use in con -\\ncurrent contexts.

Arguably, OOP languages share certain common characteristics, namely objects, encapsulation, and inheritance. Let’s look at what each of those characteristics means and whether Rust supports it.\\nObjects Contain Data and Behavior\\nThe book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (Addison-Wesley Professional, 1994) colloquially referred to as The Gang of Four book, is a catalog of object-oriented design patterns. It defines OOP this way:\\nObject-oriented programs are made up of objects. An object  pack -\\nages both data and the procedures that operate on that data. The \\nprocedures are typically called methods  or operations .\\nUsing this definition, Rust is object oriented: structs and enums have \\ndata, and impl blocks provide methods on structs and enums. Even though \\nstructs and enums with methods aren’t called  objects, they provide the same \\nfunctionality, according to the Gang of Four’s definition of objects.\\nEncapsulation That Hides Implementation Details\\nAnother aspect commonly associated with OOP is the idea of encapsulation , \\nwhich means that the implementation details of an object aren’t accessible to \\ncode using that object. Therefore, the only way to interact with an object is through its public API; code using the object shouldn’t be able to reach into the object’s internals and change data or behavior directly. This enables the programmer to change and refactor an object’s internals without needing to change the code that uses the object.\\nWe discussed how to control encapsulation in Chapter 7: we can use \\nthe \\npub keyword to decide which modules, types, functions, and methods \\nin our code should be public, and by default everything else is private. For example, we can define a struct \\nAveragedCollection  that has a field contain -\\ning a vector of i32 values. The struct can also have a field that contains \\nthe average of the values in the vector, meaning the average doesn’t have to be computed on demand whenever anyone needs it. In other words, \\nAveragedCollection  will cache the calculated average for us. Listing 17-1 has \\nthe definition of the AveragedCollection  struct.\\npub struct AveragedCollection {\\n    list: Vec<i32>,\\n    average: f64,\\n}\\nListing 17-1: An AveragedCollection  struct that maintains a list of integers and the average \\nof the items in the collection\\nThe struct is marked pub so that other code can use it, but the fields \\nwithin the struct remain private.

The average  method \\nreturns the value in the average  field, allowing external code to read the \\naverage  but not modify it.\\nBecause we’ve encapsulated the implementation details of the struct \\nAveragedCollection , we can easily change aspects, such as the data structure, in \\nthe future. For instance, we could use a HashSet<i32>  instead of a Vec<i32>  for the \\nlist field. As long as the signatures of the add, remove , and average  public meth -\\nods stay the same, code using AveragedCollection  wouldn’t need to change. If \\nwe made list public instead, this wouldn’t necessarily be the case: HashSet<i32>  \\nand Vec<i32>  have different methods for adding and removing items, so the \\nexternal code would likely have to change if it were modifying list directly.src/lib.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The option to use pub \\nor not for different parts of code enables encapsulation of implementation \\ndetails.\\nInheritance as a Type System and as Code Sharing\\nInheritance  is a mechanism whereby an object can inherit from another \\nobject’s definition, thus gaining the parent object’s data and behavior without you having to define them again.\\nIf a language must have inheritance to be an object-oriented language, \\nthen Rust is not one. There is no way to define a struct that inherits the parent struct’s fields and method implementations. However, if you’re used to having inheritance in your programming toolbox, you can use other solutions in Rust, depending on your reason for reaching for inheri -\\ntance in the first place.\\nYou choose inheritance for two main reasons. One is for reuse of code: \\nyou can implement a particular behavior for one type, and inheritance enables you to reuse that implementation for a different type. You can share Rust code using default trait method implementations instead, which you saw in Listing 10-14 when we added a default implementation of the \\nsummarize  \\nmethod on the Summary  trait. Any type implementing the Summary  trait would \\nhave the summarize  method available on it without any further code. This \\nis similar to a parent class having an implementation of a method and an inheriting child class also having the implementation of the method. We can also override the default implementation of the \\nsummarize  method when \\nwe implement the Summary  trait, which is similar to a child class overriding \\nthe implementation of a method inherited from a parent class.\\nThe other reason to use inheritance relates to the type system: to \\nenable a child type to be used in the same places as the parent type. This is also called polymorphism , which means that you can substitute multiple \\nobjects for each other at runtime if they share certain characteristics.\\nPOlymOr Phism\\nTo many people, polymorphism is synonymous with inheritance. But it’s actually \\na more general concept that refers to code that can work with data of multiple \\ntypes. For inheritance, those types are generally subclasses.\\nRust instead uses generics to abstract over different possible types and \\ntrait bounds to impose constraints on what those types must provide. This is \\nsometimes called bounded parametric polymorphism .\\nInheritance has recently fallen out of favor as a programming design \\nsolution in many programming languages because it’s often at risk of \\nsharing more code than necessary.

It also introduces the possibil -\\nity of calling methods on subclasses that don’t make sense or that cause \\nerrors because the methods don’t apply to the subclass. In addition, some languages will only allow a subclass to inherit from one class, further restricting the flexibility of a program’s design.\\nFor these reasons, Rust takes a different approach, using trait objects \\ninstead of inheritance. Let’s look at how trait objects enable polymorphism in Rust.\\nUsing Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types\\nIn Chapter 8, we mentioned that one limitation of vectors is that they can store elements of only one type. We created a workaround in Listing 8-10 where we defined a \\nSpreadsheetCell  enum that had variants to hold integers, \\nfloats, and text. This meant we could store different types of data in each cell and still have a vector that represented a row of cells. This is a perfectly good solution when our interchangeable items are a fixed set of types that we know when our code is compiled.\\nHowever, sometimes we want our library user to be able to extend the \\nset of types that are valid in a particular situation. To show how we might achieve this, we’ll create an example graphical user interface (GUI) tool that iterates through a list of items, calling a \\ndraw method on each one to draw \\nit to the screen—a common technique for GUI tools. We’ll create a library crate called \\ngui that contains the structure of a GUI library. This crate might \\ninclude some types for people to use, such as Button  or TextField . In addition, \\ngui users will want to create their own types that can be drawn: for instance, \\none programmer might add an Image  and another might add a SelectBox . \\nWe won’t implement a fully fledged GUI library for this example but will \\nshow how the pieces would fit together. At the time of writing the library, we can’t know and define all the types other programmers might want to create. But we do know that \\ngui needs to keep track of many values of different types, \\nand it needs to call a draw method on each of these differently typed values. It \\ndoesn’t need to know exactly what will happen when we call the draw method, \\njust that the value will have that method available for us to call.\\nTo do this in a language with inheritance, we might define a class named \\nComponent  that has a method named draw on it. The other classes, such as \\nButton , Image , and SelectBox , would inherit from Component  and thus inherit \\nthe draw method. They could each override the draw method to define their \\ncustom behavior, but the framework could treat all of the types as if they were \\nComponent  instances and call draw on them. But because Rust doesn’t have \\ninheritance, we need another way to structure the gui library to allow users to \\nextend it with new types.\\nDefining a Trait for Common Behavior\\nTo implement the behavior we want gui to have, we’ll define a trait named \\nDraw that will have one method named draw. Then we can define a vector \\nthat takes a trait object . A trait object points to an instance of a type that \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

We create a trait object by specifying some \\nsort of pointer, such as a & reference or a Box<T>  smart pointer, and then speci -\\nfying the relevant trait. (We’ll talk about the reason trait objects must use a pointer in “Dynamically Sized Types and the \\nSized  Trait” on page 445.) We \\ncan use trait objects in place of a generic or concrete type. Wherever we use a trait object, Rust’s type system will ensure at compile time that any value used in that context will implement the trait object’s trait. Consequently, we don’t need to know all the possible types at compile time.\\nWe’ve mentioned that in Rust, we refrain from calling structs and enums \\n“objects” to distinguish them from other languages’ objects. In a struct or enum, the data in the struct fields and the behavior in \\nimpl blocks are sepa -\\nrated, whereas in other languages, the data and behavior combined into one concept is often labeled an object. However, trait objects are  more like objects \\nin other languages in the sense that they combine data and behavior. But trait objects differ from traditional objects in that we can’t add data to a trait object. Trait objects aren’t as generally useful as objects in other languages: their specific purpose is to allow abstraction across common behavior.\\nListing 17-3 shows how to define a trait named \\nDraw with one method \\nnamed draw.\\npub trait Draw {\\n    fn draw(&self);\\n}\\nListing 17-3: Definition of the Draw trait\\nThis syntax should look familiar from our discussions on how to define \\ntraits in Chapter 10.

To imagine what the implementation might look like, a Button  struct \\nmight have fields for width , height , and label , as shown in Listing 17-7.\\npub struct Button {\\n    pub width: u32,\\n    pub height: u32,\\n    pub label: String,\\n}\\nimpl Draw for Button {\\n    fn draw(&self) {\\n        // code to actually draw a button    }\\n}\\nListing 17-7: A \\nButton  struct that implements the Draw traitsrc/lib.rs\\nsrc/lib.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Each of the types we want to draw on the screen \\nwill implement the Draw trait but will use different code in the draw method \\nto define how to draw that particular type, as Button  has here (without the \\nactual GUI code, which is beyond the scope of this chapter). The Button  \\ntype, for instance, might have an additional impl block containing methods \\nrelated to what happens when a user clicks the button. These kinds of \\nmethods won’t apply to types like TextField .\\nIf someone using our library decides to implement a SelectBox  struct \\nthat has width , height , and options  fields, they implement the Draw trait on the \\nSelectBox  type as well, as shown in Listing 17-8.\\nextern crate gui;\\nuse gui::Draw;\\nstruct SelectBox {\\n    width: u32,\\n    height: u32,    options: Vec<String>,\\n}\\nimpl Draw for SelectBox {\\n    fn draw(&self) {\\n        // code to actually draw a select box\\n    }}\\nListing 17-8: Another crate using \\ngui and implementing the Draw trait on a SelectBox  struct\\nOur library’s user can now write their main function to create a Screen  \\ninstance.

In the implementation of run on \\nScreen  in Listing 17-5, run doesn’t need to know what the concrete type of \\neach component is. It doesn’t check whether a component is an instance of a \\nButton  or a SelectBox ; it just calls the draw method on the component. By \\nspecifying Box<Draw>  as the type of the values in the components  vector, we’ve \\ndefined Screen  to need values that we can call the draw method on.\\nThe advantage of using trait objects and Rust’s type system to write \\ncode similar to code using duck typing is that we never have to check whether a value implements a particular method at runtime or worry about getting errors if a value doesn’t implement a method but we call it anyway. Rust won’t compile our code if the values don’t implement the traits that the trait objects need.\\nFor example, Listing 17-10 shows what happens if we try to create a \\nScreen  with a String  as a component.\\nextern crate gui;\\nuse gui::Screen;\\nfn main() {\\n    let screen = Screen {\\n        components: vec![            Box::new(String::from(\"Hi\")),\\n        ],\\n    };\\n    screen.run();\\n}\\nListing 17-10: Attempting to use a type that doesn’t implement the trait object’s traitsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The code that results from monomorphization is doing static dispatch , which is when the compiler knows what method you’re \\ncalling at compile time. This is opposed to dynamic dispatch , which is when the \\ncompiler can’t tell at compile time which method you’re calling. In dynamic dispatch cases, the compiler emits code that at runtime will figure out which method to call.\\nWhen we use trait objects, Rust must use dynamic dispatch. The compiler \\ndoesn’t know all the types that might be used with the code that is using trait objects, so it doesn’t know which method implemented on which type to call. Instead, at runtime, Rust uses the pointers inside the trait object to know which method to call. There is a runtime cost when this lookup happens that doesn’t occur with static dispatch. Dynamic dispatch also prevents the compiler from choosing to inline a method’s code, which in turn prevents some optimizations. However, we did get extra flexibility in the code that we wrote in Listing 17-5 and were able to support in Listing 17-9, so it’s a trade-off to consider.\\nObject Safety Is Required for Trait Objects\\nYou can only make object-safe  traits into trait objects. Some complex rules \\ngovern all the properties that make a trait object safe, but in practice, only two rules are relevant. A trait is object safe if all the methods defined in the trait have the following properties:\\n•\\tThe return type isn’t \\nSelf.\\n•\\tThere are no generic type parameters.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Trait objects must be object safe because once you’ve used \\na trait object, Rust no longer knows the concrete type that’s implementing that trait. If a trait method returns the concrete \\nSelf type, but a trait object \\nforgets the exact type that Self is, there is no way the method can use the \\noriginal concrete type. The same is true of generic type parameters that are filled in with concrete type parameters when the trait is used: the concrete types become part of the type that implements the trait. When the type is forgotten through the use of a trait object, there is no way to know what types to fill in the generic type parameters with.\\nAn example of a trait whose methods are not object safe is the standard \\nlibrary’s \\nClone  trait. The signature for the clone  method in the Clone  trait looks \\nlike this:\\npub trait Clone {\\n    fn clone(&self) -> Self;\\n}\\nThe String  type implements the Clone  trait, and when we call the clone  \\nmethod on an instance of String , we get back an instance of String . Similarly, \\nif we call clone  on an instance of Vec<T> , we get back an instance of Vec<T> . \\nThe signature of clone  needs to know what type will stand in for Self, because \\nthat’s the return type.\\nThe compiler will indicate when you’re trying to do something that \\nviolates the rules of object safety in regard to trait objects.

The crux of the pattern \\nis that a value has some internal state, which is represented by a set of state \\nobjects , and the value’s behavior changes based on the internal state. The \\nstate objects share functionality: in Rust, of course, we use structs and traits rather than objects and inheritance. Each state object is responsible for its own behavior and for governing when it should change into another state. The value that holds a state object knows nothing about the different behav -\\nior of the states or when to transition between states.\\nUsing the state pattern means when the business requirements of the \\nprogram change, we won’t need to change the code of the value holding the state or the code that uses the value. We’ll only need to update the code inside one of the state objects to change its rules or perhaps add more state objects. Let’s look at an example of the state design pattern and how to use it in Rust.\\nWe’ll implement a blog post workflow in an incremental way. The blog’s \\nfinal functionality will look like this:\\n1. A blog post starts as an empty draft.\\n2. When the draft is done, a review of the post is requested.\\n3. When the post is approved, it gets published.\\n4. Only published blog posts return content to print, so unapproved posts \\ncan’t accidentally be published.\\nAny other changes attempted on a post should have no effect. For \\nexample, if we try to approve a draft blog post before we’ve requested a \\nreview, the post should remain an unpublished draft.\\nListing 17-11 shows this workflow in code form: this is an example usage \\nof the API we’ll implement in a library crate named \\nblog.

We know we need a public \\nPost struct that holds some content, so we’ll start with the definition of \\nthe struct and an associated public new function to create an instance of Post, \\nas shown in Listing 17-12. We’ll also make a private State  trait. Then Post will \\nhold a trait object of Box<State>  inside an Option  in a private field named state . \\nYou’ll see why the Option  is necessary in a bit.\\npub struct Post {\\n    state: Option<Box<State>>,\\n    content: String,\\n}\\nimpl Post {\\n    pub fn new() -> Post {\\n        Post {\\n            \\uf075 state: Some(Box::new(Draft {})),            \\uf076 content: String::new(),\\n        }    }\\n}\\ntrait State {}struct Draft {}\\nimpl State for Draft {}\\nListing 17-12: Definition of a \\nPost struct and a new function that creates a new Post \\ninstance, a State  trait, and a Draft  structsrc/lib.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

This Box points to a new instance of the Draft  struct. This \\nensures whenever we create a new instance of Post, it will start out as a draft. \\nBecause the state  field of Post is private, there is no way to create a Post in \\nany other state! In the Post::new  function, we set the content  field to a new, \\nempty String  \\uf076. \\nStoring the Text of the Post Content\\nListing 17-11 showed that we want to be able to call a method named add_text  \\nand pass it a &str that is then added to the text content of the blog post. We \\nimplement this as a method rather than exposing the content  field as pub. This \\nmeans we can implement a method later that will control how the content  \\nfield’s data is read. The add_text  method is pretty straightforward, so let’s \\nadd the implementation in Listing 17-13 to the impl Post  block.\\nimpl Post {\\n    // --snip--\\n    pub fn add_text(&mut self, text: &str) {\\n        self.content.push_str(text);\\n    }\\n}\\nListing 17-13: Implementing the add_text  method to add text to a post’s content\\nThe add_text  method takes a mutable reference to self, because we’re \\nchanging the Post instance that we’re calling add_text  on. We then call \\npush_str  on the String  in content  and pass the text argument to add to the \\nsaved content . This behavior doesn’t depend on the state the post is in, so it’s \\nnot part of the state pattern. The add_text  method doesn’t interact with the \\nstate  field at all, but it is part of the behavior we want to support.\\nEnsuring the Content of a Draft Post Is Empty\\nEven after we’ve called add_text  and added some content to our post, we still \\nwant the content  method to return an empty string slice because the post is \\nstill in the draft state, as shown at \\uf077  in Listing 17-11. For now, let’s implement \\nthe content  method with the simplest thing that will fulfill this requirement: \\nalways returning an empty string slice. We’ll change this later once we imple -\\nment the ability to change a post’s state so it can be published. So far, posts \\ncan only be in the draft state, so the post content should always be empty.

We’ve implemented the \\nstate pattern with the rules of the blog post workflow. The logic related to the \\nrules lives in the state objects rather than being scattered throughout Post.\\nTrade-offs of the State Pattern\\nWe’ve shown that Rust is capable of implementing the object-oriented state pattern to encapsulate the different kinds of behavior a post should have in each state. The methods on \\nPost know nothing about the various behaviors. \\nThe way we organized the code, we have to look in only one place to know the different ways a published post can behave: the implementation of the \\nState  trait on the Published  struct.\\nIf we were to create an alternative implementation that didn’t use the \\nstate pattern, we might instead use match  expressions in the methods on \\nPost or even in the main code that checks the state of the post and changes \\nbehavior in those places. That would mean we would have to look in several places to understand all the implications of a post being in the published state! This would only increase the more states we added: each of those \\nmatch  expressions would need another arm.\\nWith the state pattern, the Post methods and the places we use Post don’t \\nneed match  expressions, and to add a new state, we would only need to add a \\nnew struct and implement the trait methods on that one struct.\\nThe implementation using the state pattern is easy to extend to add \\nmore functionality. To see the simplicity of maintaining code that uses the state pattern, try a few of these suggestions:\\n•\\tAdd a \\nreject  method that changes the post’s state from PendingReview  \\nback to Draft .\\n•\\tRequire two calls to approve  before the state can be changed to Published .\\n•\\tAllow users to add text content only when a post is in the Draft  state. \\nHint: have the state object be responsible for what might change about \\nthe content but not responsible for modifying the Post.\\nOne downside of the state pattern is that, because the states implement \\nthe transitions between states, some of the states are coupled to each other. If we added another state between \\nPendingReview  and Published , such as \\nScheduled , we would have to change the code in PendingReview  to transition \\nto Scheduled  instead. It would be less work if PendingReview  didn’t need to \\nchange with the addition of a new state, but that would mean switching to another design pattern.\\nAnother downside is that we’ve duplicated some logic. To eliminate some \\nof the duplication, we might try to make default implementations for the \\nrequest_review  and approve  methods on the State  trait that return self; how -\\never, this would violate object safety, because the trait doesn’t know what the concrete \\nself will be exactly. We want to be able to use State  as a trait \\nobject, so we need its methods to be object safe.\\nOther duplication includes the similar implementations of the \\nrequest_review  and approve  methods on Post.

If we had a lot \\nof methods on Post that followed this pattern, we might consider defining a \\nmacro to eliminate the repetition (see Appendix D for more on macros).\\nBy implementing the state pattern exactly as it’s defined for object-\\noriented languages, we’re not taking as full advantage of Rust’s strengths as \\nwe could. Let’s look at some changes we can make to the blog crate that can \\nmake invalid states and transitions into compile time errors.\\nEncoding States and Behavior as Types\\nWe’ll show you how to rethink the state pattern to get a different set of trade-\\noffs. Rather than encapsulating the states and transitions completely so out -\\nside code has no knowledge of them, we’ll encode the states into different types. Consequently, Rust’s type-checking system will prevent attempts to use draft posts where only published posts are allowed by issuing a compiler error.\\nLet’s consider the first part of \\nmain in Listing 17-11:\\nfn main() {\\n    let mut post = Post::new();\\n    post.add_text(\"I ate a salad for lunch today\");\\n    assert_eq!(\"\", post.content());\\n}\\nWe still enable the creation of new posts in the draft state using Post::new  \\nand the ability to add text to the post’s content. But instead of having a \\ncontent  method on a draft post that returns an empty string, we’ll make it \\nso draft posts don’t have the content  method at all. That way, if we try to \\nget a draft post’s content, we’ll get a compiler error telling us the method \\ndoesn’t exist. As a result, it will be impossible for us to accidentally display draft post content in production, because that code won’t even compile.

The structs no longer have the state  field because we’re \\nmoving the encoding of the state to the types of the structs. The Post struct \\nwill represent a published post, and it has a content  method that returns the \\ncontent  \\uf076.\\nWe still have a Post::new  function, but instead of returning an instance \\nof Post, it returns an instance of DraftPost  \\uf075. Because content  is private and \\nthere aren’t any functions that return Post, it’s not possible to create an \\ninstance of Post right now.\\nThe DraftPost  struct has an add_text  method, so we can add text to content  \\nas before \\uf077 , but note that DraftPost  does not have a content  method defined! \\nSo now the program ensures all posts start as draft posts, and draft posts \\ndon’t have their content available for display. Any attempt to get around these constraints will result in a compiler error.\\nImplementing Transitions as Transformations into Different Types\\nSo how do we get a published post? We want to enforce the rule that a draft \\npost has to be reviewed and approved before it can be published. A post in the pending review state should still not display any content. Let’s implement these constraints by adding another struct, \\nPendingReviewPost , defining the \\nrequest_review  method on DraftPost  to return a PendingReviewPost , and defin -\\ning an approve  method on PendingReviewPost  to return a Post, as shown in \\nListing  17-20.\\nimpl DraftPost {\\n    // --snip--\\n    pub fn request_review(self) -> PendingReviewPost {\\n        PendingReviewPost {\\n            content: self.content,        }\\n    }\\n}\\npub struct PendingReviewPost {\\n    content: String,\\n}src/lib.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

This way, \\nwe won’t have any lingering DraftPost  instances after we’ve called request \\n_review  on them, and so forth. The PendingReviewPost  struct doesn’t have a \\ncontent  method defined on it, so attempting to read its content results in a \\ncompiler error, as with DraftPost . Because the only way to get a published \\nPost instance that does have a content  method defined is to call the approve  \\nmethod on a PendingReviewPost , and the only way to get a PendingReviewPost  is \\nto call the request_review  method on a DraftPost , we’ve now encoded the blog \\npost workflow into the type system.\\nBut we also have to make some small changes to main. The request_review  \\nand approve  methods return new instances rather than modifying the struct \\nthey’re called on, so we need to add more let post =  shadowing assignments \\nto save the returned instances. We also can’t have the assertions about the \\ndraft and pending review post’s contents be empty strings, nor do we need them: we can’t compile code that tries to use the content of posts in those states any longer.

A pattern consists of some combination \\nof the following:\\n•\\tLiterals\\n•\\tDestructured arrays, enums, structs, or tuples\\n•\\tVariables\\n•\\tWildcards \\n•\\tPlaceholders\\nThese components describe the shape of the data we’re working with, \\nwhich we then match against values to determine whether our program has \\nthe correct data to continue running a particular piece of code.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

If the pattern matches \\nthe value, we use the value parts in our code. Recall the match  expressions \\nin Chapter 6 that used patterns, such as the coin-sorting machine example. \\nIf the value fits the shape of the pattern, we can use the named pieces. If it doesn’t, the code associated with the pattern won’t run.\\nThis chapter is a reference on all things related to patterns. We’ll \\ncover the valid places to use patterns, the difference between refutable and irrefutable patterns, and the different kinds of pattern syntax that you might see. By the end of the chapter, you’ll know how to use patterns to express many concepts in a clear way.\\nAll the Places Patterns Can Be Used\\nPatterns pop up in a number of places in Rust, and you’ve been using them a lot without realizing it! This section discusses all the places where patterns are valid.\\nmatch Arms\\nAs discussed in Chapter 6, we use patterns in the arms of match  expressions. \\nFormally, match  expressions are defined as the keyword match , a value to match \\non, and one or more match arms that consist of a pattern and an expression to run if the value matches that arm’s pattern, like this:\\nmatch VALUE {\\n    PATTERN => EXPRESSION,\\n    PATTERN => EXPRESSION,\\n    PATTERN => EXPRESSION,\\n}\\nOne requirement for match  expressions is that they need to be exhaustive  \\nin the sense that all possibilities for the value in the match  expression must be \\naccounted for. One way to ensure you’ve covered every possibility is to have a \\ncatchall pattern for the last arm: for example, a variable name matching any value can never fail and thus covers every remaining case.\\nA particular pattern \\n_ will match anything, but it never binds to a vari -\\nable, so it’s often used in the last match arm. The _ pattern can be useful \\nwhen you want to ignore any value not specified, for example. We’ll cover the \\n_ pattern in more detail in “Ignoring Values in a Pattern” on page 403.\\nConditional if let Expressions\\nIn Chapter 6, we discussed how to use if let  expressions mainly as a shorter \\nway to write the equivalent of a match  that only matches one case. Optionally, \\nif let  can have a corresponding else containing code to run if the pattern in \\nthe if let  doesn’t match.\\nListing 18-1 shows that it’s also possible to mix and match if let , else \\nif, and else if let  expressions.

If none of these conditions apply } , the background color is blue ~ .\\nThis conditional structure lets us support complex requirements. With \\nthe hardcoded values we have here, this example will print Using purple as \\nthe background color .\\nYou can see that if let  can also introduce shadowed variables in the \\nsame way that match  arms can: the line if let Ok(age) = age  y introduces \\na new shadowed age variable that contains the value inside the Ok variant. \\nThis means we need to place the if age > 30  condition z within that block: \\nwe can’t combine these two conditions into if let Ok(age) = age && age > 30 . \\nThe shadowed age we want to compare to 30 isn’t valid until the new scope \\nstarts with the curly bracket.\\nThe downside of using if let  expressions is that the compiler doesn’t \\ncheck exhaustiveness, whereas with match  expressions it does.

More for -\\nmally, a let statement looks like this:\\nlet PATTERN = EXPRESSION;\\nIn statements like let x = 5;  with a variable name in the PATTERN  slot, the \\nvariable name is just a particularly simple form of a pattern. Rust compares \\nthe expression against the pattern and assigns any names it finds. So in the \\nlet x = 5;  example, x is a pattern that means “bind what matches here to the \\nvariable x.” Because the name x is the whole pattern, this pattern effectively \\nmeans “bind everything to the variable x, whatever the value is.”\\nTo see the pattern-matching aspect of let more clearly, consider \\nListing 18-4, which uses a pattern with let to destructure a tuple.\\nlet (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3);\\nListing 18-4: Using a pattern to destructure a tuple and create three variables at once\\nHere, we match a tuple against a pattern. Rust compares the value \\n(1, 2, 3)  to the pattern (x, y, z)  and sees that the value matches the pattern, \\nso Rust binds 1 to x, 2 to y, and 3 to z. You can think of this tuple pattern as \\nnesting three individual variable patterns inside it.\\nIf the number of elements in the pattern doesn’t match the number of \\nelements in the tuple, the overall type won’t match and we’ll get a compiler \\nerror. For example, Listing 18-5 shows an attempt to destructure a tuple with three elements into two variables, which won’t work.\\nlet (x, y) = (1, 2, 3);\\nListing 18-5: Incorrectly constructing a pattern whose variables don’t match the number of \\nelements in the tuple\\nAttempting to compile this code results in this type error:\\nerror[E0308]: mismatched types --> src/main.rs:2:9\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir\"),\n",

This code is perfectly valid, although it \\nmeans we cannot use an irrefutable pattern without receiving an error. \\nIf we give if let  a pattern that will always match, such as x, as shown in \\nListing 18-10, it will not compile.\\nif let x = 5 {\\n    println!(\"{}\", x);\\n};\\nListing 18-10: Attempting to use an irrefutable pattern with if let\\nRust complains that it doesn’t make sense to use if let  with an irrefut -\\nable pattern:\\nerror[E0162]: irrefutable if-let pattern\\n --> <anon>:2:8\\n  |\\n2 | if let x = 5 {\\n  |        ^ irrefutable pattern\\nFor this reason, match arms must use refutable patterns, except for \\nthe last arm, which should match any remaining values with an irrefutable \\npattern. Rust allows us to use an irrefutable pattern in a match  with only \\none arm, but this syntax isn’t particularly useful and could be replaced with a simpler \\nlet statement.\\nNow that you know where to use patterns and the difference between \\nrefutable and irrefutable patterns, let’s cover all the syntax we can use to create patterns.\\nPattern Syntax\\nThroughout the book, you’ve seen examples of many kinds of patterns. In this section, we gather all the syntax valid in patterns and discuss why you might want to use each one.\\nMatching Literals\\nAs you saw in Chapter 6, you can match patterns against literals directly. The following code gives some examples:\\nlet x = 1;\\nmatch x {\\n    1 => println!(\"one\"),\\n    2 => println!(\"two\"),\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 426}, page_content='Patterns and Matching    397    3 => println!(\"three\"),\\n    _ => println!(\"anything\"),\\n}\\nThis code prints one because the value in x is 1. This syntax is useful when \\nyou want your code to take an action if it gets a particular concrete value.\\nMatching Named Variables\\nNamed variables are irrefutable patterns that match any value, and we’ve \\nused them many times in the book. However, there is a complication when you use named variables in \\nmatch  expressions. Because match  starts a new \\nscope, variables declared as part of a pattern inside the match  expression \\nwill shadow those with the same name outside the match  construct, as is \\nthe case with all variables. In Listing 18-11, we declare a variable named x \\nwith the value Some(5)  and a variable y with the value 10. We then create a \\nmatch  expression on the value x. Look at the patterns in the match arms and \\nprintln!  at the end and try to figure out what the code will print before run -\\nning this code or reading further.\\nfn main() {\\n    u let x = Some(5);\\n    v let y = 10;\\n    match x {\\n        w Some(50) => println!(\"Got 50\"),\\n        x Some(y) => println!(\"Matched, y = {:?}\", y),\\n        y _ => println!(\"Default case, x = {:?}\", x),\\n    }\\n    z println!(\"at the end: x = {:?}, y = {:?}\", x, y);\\n}\\nListing 18-11: A match  expression with an arm that introduces a shadowed variable y\\nLet’s walk through what happens when the match  expression runs. The \\npattern in the first match arm w doesn’t match the defined value of x u, so \\nthe code continues.\\nThe pattern in the second match arm x  introduces a new variable \\nnamed y that will match any value inside a Some value. Because we’re in a \\nnew scope inside the match  expression, this is a new y variable, not the y \\nwe declared at the beginning with the value 10 v . This new y binding will \\nmatch any value inside a Some, which is what we have in x. Therefore, this \\nnew y binds to the inner value of the Some in x. That value is 5, so the expres -\\nsion for that arm executes and prints Matched, y = 5 .\\nIf x had been a None value instead of Some(5) , the patterns in the first two \\narms wouldn’t have matched, so the value would have matched to the under -\\nscore y . We didn’t introduce the x variable in the pattern of the underscore \\narm, so the x in the expression is still the outer x that hasn’t been shadowed. \\nIn this hypothetical case, the match  would print Default case, x = None .src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 427}, page_content='398   Chapter 18When the match  expression is done, its scope ends, and so does the scope \\nof the inner y. The last println!  z produces at the end: x = Some(5), y = 10 .\\nTo create a match  expression that compares the values of the outer x \\nand y, rather than introducing a shadowed variable, we would need to use \\na match guard conditional instead. We’ll talk about match guards later in \\n“Extra Conditionals with Match Guards” on page 408.\\nMultiple Patterns\\nIn match  expressions, you can match multiple patterns using the | syntax, \\nwhich means or . For example, the following code matches the value of x \\nagainst the match arms, the first of which has an or  option, meaning if the \\nvalue of x matches either of the values in that arm, that arm’s code will run: \\nlet x = 1;\\nmatch x {\\n    1 | 2 => println!(\"one or two\"),\\n    3 => println!(\"three\"),\\n    _ => println!(\"anything\"),}\\nThis code prints one or two .\\nMatching Ranges of Values with the ... Syntax\\nThe ... syntax allows us to match to an inclusive range of values. In the \\nfollowing code, when a pattern matches any of the values within the range, \\nthat arm will execute:\\nlet x = 5;\\nmatch x {\\n    1 ... 5 => println!(\"one through five\"),\\n    _ => println!(\"something else\"),\\n}\\nIf x is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, the first arm will match. This syntax is more conve -\\nnient than using the | operator to express the same idea; instead of 1 ... 5 , \\nwe would have to specify 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5  if we used |. Specifying a range \\nis much shorter, especially if we want to match, say, any number between 1 \\nand 1,000!\\nRanges are only allowed with numeric values or char values, because \\nthe compiler checks that the range isn’t empty at compile time. The only types for which Rust can tell whether a range is empty or not are \\nchar and \\nnumeric values.\\nHere is an example using ranges of char values:\\nlet x = \\'c\\';\\nmatch x {\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Let’s walk through each value.\\nDestructuring Structs\\nListing 18-12 shows a Point  struct with two fields, x and y, that we can break \\napart using a pattern with a let statement.\\nstruct Point {\\n    x: i32,\\n    y: i32,\\n}\\nfn main() {\\n    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };\\n    let Point { x: a, y: b } = p;\\n    assert_eq!(0, a);\\n    assert_eq!(7, b);\\n}\\nListing 18-12: Destructuring a struct’s fields into separate variables \\nThis code creates the variables a and b that match the values of the x and \\ny fields of the p variable. This example shows that the names of the variables \\nin the pattern don’t have to match the field names of the struct. But it’s \\ncommon to want the variable names to match the field names to make it easier to remember which variables came from which fields. \\nBecause having variable names match the fields is common and because \\nwriting \\nlet Point { x: x, y: y } = p;  contains a lot of duplication, there is a \\nshorthand for patterns that match struct fields: you only need to list the name of the struct field, and the variables created from the pattern will have the same names. Listing 18-13 shows code that behaves in the same way as the code in Listing 18-12, but the variables created in the \\nlet pattern are x and y \\ninstead of a and b.\\nstruct Point {\\n    x: i32,\\n    y: i32,\\n}src/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The outcome is that the variables x and y contain the values \\nfrom the p struct.\\nWe can also destructure with literal values as part of the struct pattern \\nrather than creating variables for all the fields. Doing so allows us to test \\nsome of the fields for particular values while creating variables to destruc -\\nture the other fields.\\nListing 18-14 shows a match  expression that separates Point  values into \\nthree cases: points that lie directly on the x axis (which is true when y = 0 ), \\non the y axis (x = 0 ), or neither.\\nfn main() {\\n    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };\\n    match p {\\n        Point { x, y: 0 } => println!(\"On the x axis at {}\", x),\\n        Point { x: 0, y } => println!(\"On the y axis at {}\", y),        Point { x, y } => println!(\"On neither axis: ({}, {})\", x, y),\\n    }\\n}\\nListing 18-14: Destructuring and matching literal values in one pattern\\nThe first arm will match any point that lies on the x axis by specifying \\nthat the y field matches if its value matches the literal 0. The pattern still \\ncreates an x variable that we can use in the code for this arm. \\nSimilarly, the second arm matches any point on the y axis by specifying \\nthat the x field matches if its value is 0 and creates a variable y for the value \\nof the y field. The third arm doesn’t specify any literals, so it matches any \\nother Point  and creates variables for both the x and y fields.\\nIn this example, the value p matches the second arm by virtue of x con-\\ntaining a 0, so this code will print On the y axis at 7 .\\nDestructuring Enums\\nWe’ve destructured enums earlier in this book, for example, when we \\ndestructured Option<i32>  in Listing 6-5 on page 105. One detail we haven’t \\nmentioned explicitly is that the pattern to destructure an enum should corre -\\nspond to the way the data stored within the enum is defined. As an example, in Listing 18-15 we use the \\nMessage  enum from Listing 6-2 on page 98 and \\nwrite a match  with patterns that will destructure each inner value.src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

We can only match on the literal \\nMessage::Quit  value, and no variables are in that pattern.\\nFor struct-like enum variants, such as Message::Move  w, we can use a \\npattern similar to the pattern we specify to match structs. After the variant \\nname, we place curly brackets and then list the fields with variables so we break apart the pieces to use in the code for this arm. Here we use the short -\\nhand form as we did in Listing 18-13.\\nFor tuple-like enum variants, like \\nMessage::Write  that holds a tuple with \\none element x and Message::ChangeColor  that holds a tuple with three ele -\\nments y , the pattern is similar to the pattern we specify to match tuples. \\nThe number of variables in the pattern must match the number of elements in the variant we’re matching.src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Doing so lets us get a variable holding the value \\nthat the reference points to rather than getting a variable that holds the ref -\\nerence. This technique is especially useful in closures where we have itera -\\ntors that iterate over references, but we want to use the values in the closure rather than the references.\\nThe example in Listing 18-16 iterates over references to \\nPoint  instances \\nin a vector, destructuring the reference and the struct so we can perform calculations on the \\nx and y values easily.\\nlet points = vec![\\n    Point { x: 0, y: 0 },\\n    Point { x: 1, y: 5 },\\n    Point { x: 10, y: -3 },\\n];\\nlet sum_of_squares: i32 = points\\n    .iter()\\n    .map(|&Point { x, y }| x * x + y * y)\\n    .sum();\\nListing 18-16: Destructuring a reference to a struct into the struct field values \\nThis code gives us the variable sum_of_squares  holding the value 135, \\nwhich is the result of squaring the x value and the y value, adding those \\ntogether, and then adding the result for each Point  in the points  vector to \\nget one number.\\nIf we had not included the & in &Point { x, y } , we’d get a type mismatch \\nerror, because iter would then iterate over references to the items in the \\nvector rather than the actual values. The error would look like this:\\nerror[E0308]: mismatched types\\n  -->\\n   |\\n14 |         .map(|Point { x, y }| x * x + y * y)\\n   |               ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected &Point, found struct `Point`\\n   |   = note: expected type `&Point`\\n              found type `Point`\\nThis error indicates that Rust was expecting our closure to match &Point  \\nbut we tried to match directly to a Point  value, not a reference to a Point .\\nDestructuring Structs and Tuples\\nWe can mix, match, and nest destructuring patterns in even more complex \\nways. The following example shows a complicated destructure where we nest structs and tuples inside a tuple and destructure all the primitive values out:\\nlet ((feet, inches), Point {x, y}) = ((3, 10), Point { x: 3, y: -10 });\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

There are a few ways to ignore entire values or parts of values in a pattern: using the \\n_ pattern \\n(which you’ve seen), using the _ pattern within another pattern, using a \\nname that starts with an underscore, or using .. to ignore remaining parts \\nof a value. Let’s explore how and why to use each of these patterns.\\nIgnoring an Entire Value with _\\nWe’ve used the underscore ( _) as a wildcard pattern that will match any \\nvalue but not bind to the value. Although the _ pattern is especially useful \\nas the last arm in a match  expression, we can use it in any pattern, including \\nfunction parameters, as shown in Listing 18-17.\\nfn foo(_: i32, y: i32) {\\n    println!(\"This code only uses the y parameter: {}\", y);\\n}\\nfn main() {\\n    foo(3, 4);}\\nListing 18-17: Using \\n_ in a function signature\\nThis code will completely ignore the value passed as the first argument, \\n3, and will print This code only uses the y parameter: 4 . \\nIn most cases when you no longer need a particular function parameter, \\nyou would change the signature so it doesn’t include the unused parameter. \\nIgnoring a function parameter can be especially useful in some cases, for example, when implementing a trait when you need a certain type signa -\\nture but the function body in your implementation doesn’t need one of the parameters. The compiler will then not warn about unused function param -\\neters, as it would if you used a name instead.\\nIgnoring Parts of a Value with a Nested _\\nWe can also use \\n_ inside another pattern to ignore just part of a value, for \\nexample, when we want to test for only part of a value but have no use for the \\nother parts in the corresponding code we want to run. Listing 18-18 shows code responsible for managing a setting’s value. The business requirements are that the user should not be allowed to overwrite an existing customiza -\\ntion of a setting but can unset the setting and can give the setting a value if it is currently unset.src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

In the first match arm, we don’t need to match \\non or use the values inside either Some variant, but we do need to test for \\nthe case when setting_value  and new_setting_value  are the Some variant. In \\nthat case, we print why we’re not changing setting_value , and it doesn’t get \\nchanged.\\nIn all other cases (if either setting_value  or new_setting_value  are None) \\nexpressed by the _ pattern in the second arm, we want to allow new_setting \\n_value  to become setting_value .\\nWe can also use underscores in multiple places within one pattern to \\nignore particular values. Listing 18-19 shows an example of ignoring the \\nsecond and fourth values in a tuple of five items.\\nlet numbers = (2, 4, 8, 16, 32);\\nmatch numbers {\\n    (first, _, third, _, fifth) => {\\n        println!(\"Some numbers: {}, {}, {}\", first, third, fifth)\\n    },}\\nListing 18-19: Ignoring multiple parts of a tuple\\nThis code will print Some numbers: 2, 8, 32 , and the values 4 and 16 will \\nbe ignored.\\nIgnoring an Unused Variable by Starting Its Name with _\\nIf you create a variable but don’t use it anywhere, Rust will usually issue a \\nwarning because that could be a bug. But sometimes it’s useful to create a variable you won’t use yet, such as when you’re prototyping or just start -\\ning a project. In this situation, you can tell Rust not to warn you about the unused variable by starting the name of the variable with an underscore. In Listing 18-20, we create two unused variables, but when we run this code, we should get a warning about only one of them.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

To show a case where this distinc -\\ntion matters, Listing 18-21 will provide us with an error.\\nlet s = Some(String::from(\"Hello!\"));\\nif let Some(_s) = s {\\n    println!(\"found a string\");\\n}\\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", s);\\nListing 18-21: An unused variable starting with an underscore still binds the value, which \\nmight take ownership of the value\\nWe’ll receive an error because the s value will still be moved into _s, \\nwhich prevents us from using s again.

The reason is, again, that in patterns, \\nthe latter is for matching existing mutable references, not creating new ones. \\nListing 18-28 shows an example of a pattern creating a mutable reference.\\nlet mut robot_name = Some(String::from(\"Bors\"));\\nmatch robot_name {\\n    Some(ref mut name) => *name = String::from(\"Another name\"),\\n    None => (),\\n}\\nprintln!(\"robot_name is: {:?}\", robot_name);\\nListing 18-28: Creating a mutable reference to a value as part of a pattern using ref mut\\nThis example will compile and print robot_name is: Some(\"Another name\") . \\nBecause name is a mutable reference, we need to dereference within the match \\narm code using the * operator to mutate the value.\\nExtra Conditionals with Match Guards\\nA match guard  is an additional if condition specified after the pattern in a \\nmatch  arm that must also match, along with the pattern matching, for that \\narm to be chosen. Match guards are useful for expressing more complex \\nideas than a pattern alone allows.\\nThe condition can use variables created in the pattern. Listing 18-29 \\nshows a match  where the first arm has the pattern Some(x)  and also has a \\nmatch guard of if x < 5 .\\nlet num = Some(4);\\nmatch num {\\n    Some(x) if x < 5 => println!(\"less than five: {}\", x),\\n    Some(x) => println!(\"{}\", x),\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

When num is compared to the \\npattern in the first arm, it matches, because Some(4)  matches Some(x) . Then \\nthe match guard checks whether the value in x is less than 5, and because it \\nis, the first arm is selected.\\nIf num had been Some(10)  instead, the match guard in the first arm would \\nhave been false because 10 is not less than 5. Rust would then go to the \\nsecond arm, which would match because the second arm doesn’t have a match guard and therefore matches any \\nSome variant.\\nThere is no way to express the if x < 5  condition within a pattern, so \\nthe match guard gives us the ability to express this logic.\\nIn the discussion of Listing 18-11, we mentioned that we could use \\nmatch guards to solve our pattern-shadowing problem. Recall that a new variable was created inside the pattern in the \\nmatch  expression instead of \\nusing the variable outside the match . That new variable meant we couldn’t \\ntest against the value of the outer variable. Listing 18-30 shows how we can use a match guard to fix this problem.\\nfn main() {\\n    let x = Some(5);\\n    let y = 10;\\n    match x {\\n        Some(50) => println!(\"Got 50\"),        Some(n) if n == y => println!(\"Matched, n = {:?}\", n),\\n        _ => println!(\"Default case, x = {:?}\", x),\\n    }\\n    println!(\"at the end: x = {:?}, y = {:?}\", x, y);\\n}\\nListing 18-30: Using a match guard to test for equality with an outer variable\\nThis code will now print Default case, x = Some(5) . The pattern in the \\nsecond match arm doesn’t introduce a new variable y that would shadow \\nthe outer y, meaning we can use the outer y in the match guard. Instead \\nof specifying the pattern as Some(y) , which would have shadowed the outer \\ny, we specify Some(n) . This creates a new variable n that doesn’t shadow any -\\nthing because there is no n variable outside the match .\\nThe match guard if n == y  is not a pattern and therefore doesn’t intro -\\nduce new variables. This y is the outer y rather than a new shadowed y, and \\nwe can look for a value that has the same value as the outer y by comparing \\nn to y.\\nYou can also use the or  operator | in a match guard to specify mul -\\ntiple patterns; the match guard condition will apply to all the patterns. \\nListing 18-31 shows the precedence of combining a match guard with a src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The important part of this example is that the if y \\nmatch guard applies to 4, 5, and  6, even though it might look like if y \\nonly applies to 6.\\nlet x = 4;\\nlet y = false;\\nmatch x {\\n    4 | 5 | 6 if y => println!(\"yes\"),\\n    _ => println!(\"no\"),}\\nListing 18-31: Combining multiple patterns with a match guard\\nThe match condition states that the arm matches only if the value of x \\nis equal to 4, 5, or 6 and  if y is true. When this code runs, the pattern of the \\nfirst arm matches because x is 4, but the match guard if y is false, so the first \\narm is not chosen. The code moves on to the second arm, which does match, \\nand this program prints no. The reason is that the if condition applies to the \\nwhole pattern 4 | 5 | 6 , not only to the last value 6. In other words, the prece -\\ndence of a match guard in relation to a pattern behaves like this:\\n(4 | 5 | 6) if y => ...\\nrather than this:\\n4 | 5 | (6 if y) => ...\\nAfter running the code, the precedence behavior is evident: if the match \\nguard were applied only to the final value in the list of values specified using the \\n| operator, the arm would have matched and the program would have \\nprinted yes.\\n@ Bindings\\nThe at  operator ( @) lets us create a variable that holds a value at the same \\ntime we’re testing that value to see whether it matches a pattern. Listing 18-32 shows an example where we want to test whether a \\nMessage::Hello  id field is \\nwithin the range 3...7 . But we also want to bind the value to the variable \\nid_variable  so we can use it in the code associated with the arm. We could \\nname this variable id, the same as the field, but for this example, we’ll use a \\ndifferent name.\\nenum Message {\\n    Hello { id: i32 },\\n}\\nlet msg = Message::Hello { id: 5 };\\nmatch msg {\\n    Message::Hello { id: id_variable @ 3...7 } => {\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

By specifying id_variable \\n@ before the range 3...7 , we’re capturing whatever value matched the range \\nwhile also testing that the value matched the range pattern.\\nIn the second arm, where we only have a range specified in the pattern, \\nthe code associated with the arm doesn’t have a variable that contains the \\nactual value of the id field. The id field’s value could have been 10, 11, or \\n12, but the code that goes with that pattern doesn’t know which it is. The pattern code isn’t able to use the value from the \\nid field, because we haven’t \\nsaved the id value in a variable.\\nIn the last arm, where we’ve specified a variable without a range, we \\ndo have the value available to use in the arm’s code in a variable named \\nid. The reason is that we’ve used the struct field shorthand syntax. But we \\nhaven’t applied any test to the value in the id field in this arm, as we did \\nwith the first two arms: any value would match this pattern.\\nUsing @ lets us test a value and save it in a variable within one pattern.\\nSummary\\nRust’s patterns are very useful in that they help distinguish between different kinds of data. When used in \\nmatch  expressions, Rust ensures your patterns \\ncover every possible value, or your program won’t compile. Patterns in let \\nstatements and function parameters make those constructs more useful, enabling the destructuring of values into smaller parts at the same time as assigning to variables.

Let’s dive in!\\nUnsafe Rust\\nAll the code we’ve discussed so far has had Rust’s memory safety guarantees \\nenforced at compile time. However, Rust has a second language hidden inside it that doesn’t enforce these memory safety guarantees: it’s called unsafe Rust  and works just like regular Rust, but gives us extra superpowers.\\nUnsafe Rust exists because, by nature, static analysis is conservative. \\nWhen the compiler tries to determine whether or not code upholds the guarantees, it’s better for it to reject some valid programs rather than accept some invalid programs. Although the code might be okay, as far as Rust is able to tell, it’s not! In these cases, you can use unsafe code to tell the compiler, “Trust me, I know what I’m doing.” The downside is that you use it at your own risk: if you use unsafe code incorrectly, problems due to memory unsafety, such as null pointer dereferencing, can occur.\\nAnother reason Rust has an unsafe alter ego is that the underlying com -\\nputer hardware is inherently unsafe. If Rust didn’t let you do unsafe opera -\\ntions, you couldn’t do certain tasks. Rust needs to allow you to do low-level systems programming, such as directly interacting with the operating system or even writing your own operating system. Indeed, working with low-level systems programming is one of the goals of the language. Let’s explore what we can do with unsafe Rust and how to do it.\\nUnsafe Superpowers\\nTo switch to unsafe Rust, use the unsafe  keyword and then start a new block \\nthat holds the unsafe code. You can take four actions in unsafe Rust, called unsafe superpowers , that you can’t in safe Rust. Those superpowers include \\nthe ability to:\\n•\\tDereference a raw pointer \\n•\\tCall an unsafe function or method\\n•\\tAccess or modify a mutable static variable\\n•\\tImplement an unsafe traitIt’s important to understand that \\nunsafe  doesn’t turn off the borrow \\nchecker or disable any other of Rust’s safety checks: if you use a reference \\nin unsafe code, it will still be checked. The unsafe  keyword only gives you \\naccess to these four features that are then not checked by the compiler for memory safety. You’ll still get some degree of safety inside of an unsafe block.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 444}, page_content='Advanced Features    415In addition, unsafe  does not mean the code inside the block is necessarily \\ndangerous or that it will definitely have memory safety problems: the intent \\nis that as the programmer, you’ll ensure the code inside an unsafe  block will \\naccess memory in a valid way.\\nPeople are fallible, and mistakes will happen, but by requiring these \\nfour unsafe operations to be inside blocks annotated with unsafe  you’ll \\nknow that any errors related to memory safety must be within an unsafe  \\nblock. Keep unsafe  blocks small; you’ll be thankful later when you investi -\\ngate memory bugs.\\nTo isolate unsafe code as much as possible, it’s best to enclose unsafe \\ncode within a safe abstraction and provide a safe API, which we’ll discuss later in the chapter when we examine unsafe functions and methods. Parts of the standard library are implemented as safe abstractions over unsafe code that has been audited. Wrapping unsafe code in a safe abstraction prevents uses of \\nunsafe  from leaking out into all the places that you or your \\nusers might want to use the functionality implemented with unsafe  code, \\nbecause using a safe abstraction is safe. \\nLet’s look at each of the four unsafe superpowers in turn. We’ll also \\nlook at some abstractions that provide a safe interface to unsafe code.\\nDereferencing a Raw Pointer\\nIn “Dangling References” on page 72, we mentioned that the compiler ensures references are always valid. Unsafe Rust has two new types called raw pointers that are similar to references. As with references, raw pointers can be immutable or mutable and are written as \\n*const T  and *mut T , respec -\\ntively. The asterisk isn’t the dereference operator; it’s part of the type name. In the context of raw pointers, immutable  means that the pointer can’t be \\ndirectly assigned to after being dereferenced.\\nDifferent from references and smart pointers, raw pointers:\\n•\\tAre allowed to ignore the borrowing rules by having both immutable and mutable pointers or multiple mutable pointers to the same location\\n•\\tAren’t guaranteed to point to valid memory\\n•\\tAre allowed to be null\\n•\\tDon’t implement any automatic cleanup\\nBy opting out of having Rust enforce these guarantees, you can give up \\nguaranteed safety in exchange for greater performance or the ability to inter -\\nface with another language or hardware where Rust’s guarantees don’t apply.\\nListing 19-1 shows how to create an immutable and a mutable raw \\npointer from references.\\nlet mut num = 5;\\nlet r1 = &num as *const i32;\\nlet r2 = &mut num as *mut i32;\\nListing 19-1: Creating raw pointers from references\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 445}, page_content='416   Chapter 19Notice that we don’t include the unsafe  keyword in this code. We can \\ncreate raw pointers in safe code; we just can’t dereference raw pointers \\noutside an unsafe block, as you’ll see in a bit.\\nWe’ve created raw pointers by using as to cast an immutable and a \\nmutable reference into their corresponding raw pointer types. Because we created them directly from references guaranteed to be valid, we know these particular raw pointers are valid, but we can’t make that assumption about just any raw pointer.\\nNext, we’ll create a raw pointer whose validity we can’t be so certain \\nof. Listing 19-2 shows how to create a raw pointer to an arbitrary location in memory. Trying to use arbitrary memory is undefined: there might be data at that address or there might not, the compiler might optimize the code so there is no memory access, or the program might error with a seg -\\nmentation fault. Usually, there is no good reason to write code like this, but it is possible.\\nlet address = 0x012345usize;\\nlet r = address as *const i32;\\nListing 19-2: Creating a raw pointer to an arbitrary memory address\\nRecall that we can create raw pointers in safe code, but we can’t dereference  \\nraw pointers and read the data being pointed to. In Listing 19-3, we use the \\ndereference operator * on a raw pointer that requires an unsafe  block.\\nlet mut num = 5;\\nlet r1 = &num as *const i32;\\nlet r2 = &mut num as *mut i32;\\nunsafe {\\n    println!(\"r1 is: {}\", *r1);\\n    println!(\"r2 is: {}\", *r2);\\n}\\nListing 19-3: Dereferencing raw pointers within an unsafe  block\\nCreating a pointer does no harm; it’s only when we try to access the \\nvalue that it points at that we might end up dealing with an invalid value.\\nNote also that in Listings 19-1 and 19-3, we created *const i32  and *mut \\ni32 raw pointers that both pointed to the same memory location, where num \\nis stored. If we instead tried to create an immutable and a mutable refer -\\nence to num, the code would not have compiled because Rust’s ownership \\nrules don’t allow a mutable reference at the same time as any immutable \\nreferences. With raw pointers, we can create a mutable pointer and an immu -\\ntable pointer to the same location and change data through the mutable pointer, potentially creating a data race. Be careful!\\nWith all of these dangers, why would you ever use raw pointers? One \\nmajor use case is when interfacing with C code, as you’ll see in the next \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Another case is when building up safe abstractions that the borrow \\nchecker doesn’t understand. We’ll introduce unsafe functions and then look at an example of a safe abstraction that uses unsafe code.\\nCalling an Unsafe Function or Method\\nThe second type of operation that requires an unsafe block is calls to unsafe functions. Unsafe functions and methods look exactly like regular functions and methods, but they have an extra \\nunsafe  before the rest of \\nthe definition. The unsafe  keyword in this context indicates the function \\nhas requirements we need to uphold when we call this function, because Rust can’t guarantee we’ve met these requirements. By calling an unsafe function within an \\nunsafe  block, we’re saying that we’ve read this func -\\ntion’s documentation and take responsibility for upholding the function’s contracts.\\nHere is an unsafe function named \\ndangerous  that doesn’t do anything in \\nits body:\\nunsafe fn dangerous() {}\\nunsafe {\\n    dangerous();\\n}\\nWe must call the dangerous  function within a separate unsafe  block. If we \\ntry to call dangerous  without the unsafe  block, we’ll get an error:\\nerror[E0133]: call to unsafe function requires unsafe function or block\\n -->\\n  |\\n4 |     dangerous();\\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^ call to unsafe function\\nBy inserting the unsafe  block around our call to dangerous , we’re assert -\\ning to Rust that we’ve read the function’s documentation, we understand \\nhow to use it properly, and we’ve verified that we’re fulfilling the contract of the function.\\nBodies of unsafe functions are effectively \\nunsafe  blocks, so to perform \\nother unsafe operations within an unsafe function, we don’t need to add another \\nunsafe  block.\\nCreating a Safe Abstraction over Unsafe Code\\nJust because a function contains unsafe code doesn’t mean we need to mark \\nthe entire function as unsafe. In fact, wrapping unsafe code in a safe func -\\ntion is a common abstraction. As an example, let’s study a function from the standard library, \\nsplit_at_mut , that requires some unsafe code and explore \\nhow we might implement it. This safe method is defined on mutable slices: it takes one slice and makes it two by splitting the slice at the index given as an argument.

The assertion means that if we pass an index that is greater than the index to split the slice at, the function will panic before it attempts to use that index.\\nThen we return two mutable slices in a tuple: one from the start of the \\noriginal slice to the \\nmid index and another from mid to the end of the slice.\\nWhen we try to compile the code in Listing 19-5, we’ll get an error:\\nerror[E0499]: cannot borrow `*slice` as mutable more than once at a time\\n -->\\n  |\\n6 |     (&mut slice[..mid],\\n  |           ----- first mutable borrow occurs here\\n7 |      &mut slice[mid..])  |           ^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here\\n8 | }\\n  | - first borrow ends here\\nRust’s borrow checker can’t understand that we’re borrowing different \\nparts of the slice; it only knows that we’re borrowing from the same slice \\ntwice.

We use the len method to get the \\nlength of a slice u and the as_mut_ptr  method to access the raw pointer of a \\nslice v . In this case, because we have a mutable slice to i32 values, as_mut_ptr  \\nreturns a raw pointer with the type *mut i32 , which we’ve stored in the vari -\\nable ptr.\\nWe keep the assertion that the mid index is within the slice w . Then we \\nget to the unsafe code x : the slice::from_raw_parts_mut  function takes a raw \\npointer and a length, and it creates a slice. We use this function to create \\na slice that starts from ptr and is mid items long y . Then we call the offset  \\nmethod on ptr with mid as an argument to get a raw pointer that starts at \\nmid, and we create a slice using that pointer and the remaining number of \\nitems after mid as the length z .\\nThe function slice::from_raw_parts_mut  is unsafe because it takes a raw \\npointer and must trust that this pointer is valid. The offset  method on raw \\npointers is also unsafe, because it must trust that the offset location is also a valid pointer. Therefore, we had to put an \\nunsafe  block around our calls \\nto slice::from_raw_parts_mut  and offset  so we could call them. By looking at \\nthe code and by adding the assertion that mid must be less than or equal to \\nlen, we can tell that all the raw pointers used within the unsafe  block will be \\nvalid pointers to data within the slice.

Instead of an extern  block, we add the extern  keyword \\nand specify the ABI to use just before the fn keyword. We also need to add a \\n#[no_mangle]  annotation to tell the Rust compiler not to mangle the name of this \\nfunction. Mangling  is when a compiler changes the name we’ve given a func -\\ntion to a different name that contains more information for other parts of the \\ncompilation process to consume but is less human readable. Every program -\\nming language compiler mangles names slightly differently, so for a Rust func -\\ntion to be nameable by other languages, we must disable the Rust compiler’s name mangling.\\nIn the following example, we make the \\ncall_from_c  function accessible \\nfrom C code, after it’s compiled to a shared library and linked from C:\\n#[no_mangle]\\npub extern \"C\" fn call_from_c() {    println!(\"Just called a Rust function from C!\");\\n}\\nThis usage of extern  does not require unsafe .\\nAccessing or Modifying a Mutable Static Variable\\nUntil now, we’ve not talked about global variables , which Rust does support \\nbut can be problematic with Rust’s ownership rules. If two threads are \\naccessing the same mutable global variable, a data race can result.\\nIn Rust, global variables are called static  variables. Listing 19-9 shows an \\nexample declaration and use of a static variable with a string slice as a value.\\nstatic HELLO_WORLD: &str = \"Hello, world!\";\\nfn main() {\\n    println!(\"name is: {}\", HELLO_WORLD);\\n}\\nListing 19-9: Defining and using an immutable static variable\\nStatic variables are similar to constants, which we discussed in “Differences \\nBetween Variables and Constants” on page 34. The names of static variables \\nare in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE  by convention, and we must  annotate the variable’s \\ntype, which is &\\'static str  in this example. Static variables can only store ref -\\nerences with the \\'static  lifetime, which means the Rust compiler can figure \\nout the lifetime; we don’t need to annotate it explicitly. Accessing an immu -\\ntable static variable is safe.\\nConstants and immutable static variables might seem similar, but a \\nsubtle difference is that values in a static variable have a fixed address src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Constants, \\non the other hand, are allowed to duplicate their data whenever they are used.\\nAnother difference between constants and static variables is that static \\nvariables can be mutable. Accessing and modifying mutable static variables is unsafe . Listing 19-10 shows how to declare, access, and modify a mutable \\nstatic variable named \\nCOUNTER .\\nstatic mut COUNTER: u32 = 0;\\nfn add_to_count(inc: u32) {\\n    unsafe {\\n        COUNTER += inc;\\n    }}\\nfn main() {\\n    add_to_count(3);\\n    unsafe {\\n        println!(\"COUNTER: {}\", COUNTER);    }\\n}\\nListing 19-10: Reading from or writing to a mutable static variable is unsafe.\\nAs with regular variables, we specify mutability using the mut keyword. Any \\ncode that reads or writes from COUNTER  must be within an unsafe  block. This code \\ncompiles and prints COUNTER: 3  as we would expect because it’s single threaded. \\nHaving multiple threads access COUNTER  would likely result in data races.\\nWith mutable data that is globally accessible, it’s difficult to ensure there \\nare no data races, which is why Rust considers mutable static variables to be \\nunsafe. Where possible, it’s preferable to use the concurrency techniques and thread-safe smart pointers we discussed in Chapter 16 so the compiler checks that data accessed from different threads is done safely.\\nImplementing an Unsafe Trait\\nThe final action that works only with unsafe  is implementing an unsafe trait. \\nA trait is unsafe when at least one of its methods has some invariant that the compiler can’t verify. We can declare that a trait is \\nunsafe  by adding the unsafe  \\nkeyword before trait  and marking the implementation of the trait as unsafe  \\ntoo, as shown in Listing 19-11.\\nunsafe trait Foo {\\n    // methods go here\\n}\\nunsafe impl Foo for i32 {\\n    // method implementations go here}\\nListing 19-11: Defining and implementing an unsafe traitsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

If we implement a type that contains a type \\nthat is not Send or Sync, such as raw pointers, and we want to mark that type \\nas Send or Sync, we must use unsafe . Rust can’t verify that our type upholds \\nthe guarantees that it can be safely sent across threads or accessed from multiple threads; therefore, we need to do those checks manually and indi -\\ncate as such with \\nunsafe .\\nWhen to Use Unsafe Code\\nUsing unsafe  to take one of the four actions (superpowers) just discussed \\nisn’t wrong or even frowned upon. But it is trickier to get unsafe  code correct \\nbecause the compiler can’t help uphold memory safety. When you have a rea -\\nson to use unsafe  code, you can do so, and having the explicit unsafe  annota -\\ntion makes it easier to track down the source of problems if they occur.\\nAdvanced Lifetimes\\nIn “Validating References with Lifetimes” on page 187, you learned how to annotate references with lifetime parameters to tell Rust how lifetimes of different references relate. You saw how every reference has a lifetime, but most of the time, Rust will let you elide lifetimes. Now we’ll look at three advanced features of lifetimes that we haven’t covered yet:\\nLifetime subtyping  Ensures that one lifetime outlives another lifetime\\nLifetime bounds  Specifies a lifetime for a reference to a generic type\\nInference of trait object lifetimes Allows the compiler to infer trait \\nobject lifetimes and when they need to be specified\\nEnsuring One Lifetime Outlives Another with Lifetime Subtyping\\nLifetime subtyping  specifies that one lifetime should outlive another lifetime. \\nTo explore lifetime subtyping, imagine we want to write a parser. We’ll use a structure called \\nContext  that holds a reference to the string we’re parsing. \\nWe’ll write a parser that will parse this string and return success or failure. The parser will need to borrow the \\nContext  to do the parsing. Listing 19-12 \\nimplements this parser code, except the code doesn’t have the required life -\\ntime annotations, so it won’t compile.\\nstruct Context(&str);\\nstruct Parser {\\n    context: &Context,\\n}src/lib.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

That is, \\nthe function will do nothing on success and, on failure, will return the part \\nof the string slice that didn’t parse correctly. A real implementation would provide more error information and would return a structured data type when parsing succeeds. We won’t be discussing those details because they aren’t relevant to the lifetimes part of this example.\\nTo keep this code simple, we won’t write any parsing logic. However, it’s \\nvery likely that somewhere in the parsing logic we would handle invalid input by returning an error that references the part of the input that is invalid; this reference is what makes the code example interesting in regard to lifetimes. Let’s pretend that the logic of our parser is that the input is invalid after the first byte. Note that this code might panic if the first byte is not on a valid character boundary; again, we’re simplifying the example to focus on the lifetimes involved.\\nTo get this code to compile, we need to fill in the lifetime parameters \\nfor the string slice in \\nContext  and the reference to the Context  in Parser . \\nThe most straightforward way to do this is to use the same lifetime name everywhere, as shown in Listing 19-13. Recall from “Lifetime Annotations in Struct Definitions” on page 194 that each of \\nstruct Context<'a> , struct \\nParser<'a> , and impl<'a>  is declaring a new lifetime parameter.

The \\nimplementor of a trait will specify the concrete type to be used in this type’s place for the particular implementation. That way, we can define a trait that uses some types without needing to know exactly what those types are until the trait is implemented.\\nWe’ve described most of the advanced features in this chapter as being \\nrarely needed. Associated types are somewhere in the middle: they’re used more rarely than features explained in the rest of the book but more com -\\nmonly than many of the other features discussed in this chapter.\\nOne example of a trait with an associated type is the \\nIterator  trait that \\nthe standard library provides. The associated type is named Item and stands \\nin for the type of the values the type implementing the Iterator  trait is iterat -\\ning over. In “The Iterator  Trait and the next Method” on page 271 , we men -\\ntioned that the definition of the Iterator  trait is as shown in Listing 19-20.\\npub trait Iterator {\\n    type Item;\\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;\\n}\\nListing 19-20: The definition of the Iterator  trait that has an associated type Item\\nThe type Item is a placeholder type, and the next method’s definition \\nshows that it will return values of type Option<Self::Item> . Implementors of \\nthe Iterator  trait will specify the concrete type for Item, and the next method \\nwill return an Option  containing a value of that concrete type.\\nAssociated types might seem similar to generics, in that the latter allow \\nus to define a function without specifying what types it can handle. So why \\nuse associated types?\\nLet’s examine the difference between the two concepts with an example \\nfrom Chapter 13 that implements the Iterator  trait on the Counter  struct. In \\nListing 13-21 on page 276, we specified that the Item type was u32:\\nimpl Iterator for Counter {\\n    type Item = u32;\\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {\\n        // --snip--\\nThis syntax seems comparable to that of generics.

In other words, when a trait has a generic \\nparameter, it can be implemented for a type multiple times, changing the \\nconcrete types of the generic type parameters each time. When we use the \\nnext method on Counter , we would have to provide type annotations to indi -\\ncate which implementation of Iterator  we want to use.\\nWith associated types, we don’t need to annotate types because we can’t \\nimplement a trait on a type multiple times. In Listing 19-20 with the defini -\\ntion that uses associated types, we can only choose what the type of Item will \\nbe once, because there can only be one impl Iterator for Counter . We don’t \\nhave to specify that we want an iterator of u32 values everywhere that we call \\nnext on Counter .\\nDefault Generic Type Parameters and Operator Overloading\\nWhen we use generic type parameters, we can specify a default concrete type for the generic type. This eliminates the need for implementors of the trait to specify a concrete type if the default type works. The syntax for specifying a default type for a generic type is \\n<PlaceholderType=ConcreteType>  \\nwhen declaring the generic type.\\nA great example of a situation where this technique is useful is with \\noperator overloading. Operator overloading is customizing the behavior of an operator (such as \\n+) in particular situations.\\nRust doesn’t allow you to create your own operators or overload arbitrary \\noperators. But you can overload the operations and corresponding traits listed in \\nstd::ops  by implementing the traits associated with the operator. \\nFor example, in Listing 19-22 we overload the + operator to add two Point  \\ninstances together. We do this by implementing the Add trait on a Point  struct.\\nuse std::ops::Add;\\n#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]\\nstruct Point {\\n    x: i32,\\n    y: i32,}\\nimpl Add for Point {\\n    type Output = Point;\\n    fn add(self, other: Point) -> Point {\\n        Point {            x: self.x + other.x,\\n            y: self.y + other.y,\\n        }\\n    }\\n}src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The Add trait has an associated \\ntype named Output  that determines the type returned from the add method.\\nThe default generic type in this code is within the Add trait. Here is its \\ndefinition:\\ntrait Add<RHS=Self> {\\n    type Output;\\n    fn add(self, rhs: RHS) -> Self::Output;\\n}\\nThis code should look generally familiar: a trait with one method and \\nan associated type. The new part is RHS=Self : this syntax is called default type \\nparameters . The RHS generic type parameter (short for “right-hand side”) \\ndefines the type of the rhs parameter in the add method. If we don’t specify \\na concrete type for RHS when we implement the Add trait, the type of RHS will \\ndefault to Self, which will be the type we’re implementing Add on.\\nWhen we implemented Add for Point , we used the default for RHS because \\nwe wanted to add two Point  instances. Let’s look at an example of implement -\\ning the Add trait where we want to customize the RHS type rather than using \\nthe default.\\nWe have two structs, Millimeters  and Meters , holding values in different \\nunits. We want to add values in millimeters to values in meters and have the \\nimplementation of Add do the conversion correctly. We can implement Add \\nfor Millimeters  with Meters  as the RHS, as shown in Listing 19-23.\\nuse std::ops::Add;\\nstruct Millimeters(u32);\\nstruct Meters(u32);\\nimpl Add<Meters> for Millimeters {\\n    type Output = Millimeters;\\n    fn add(self, other: Meters) -> Millimeters {\\n        Millimeters(self.0 + (other.0 * 1000))\\n    }\\n}\\nListing 19-23: Implementing the Add trait on Millimeters  to add Millimeters  to Meters\\nTo add Millimeters  and Meters , we specify impl Add<Meters>  to set the \\nvalue of the RHS type parameter instead of using the default of Self.src/lib.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Using a default type parameter in the Add trait \\ndefinition means you don’t have to specify the extra parameter most of \\nthe time. In other words, a bit of implementation boilerplate isn’t needed, making it easier to use the trait.\\nThe first purpose is similar to the second but in reverse: if you want to \\nadd a type parameter to an existing trait, you can give it a default to allow extension of the functionality of the trait without breaking the existing implementation code.\\nFully Qualified Syntax for Disambiguation:  \\nCalling Methods with the Same Name\\nNothing in Rust prevents a trait from having a method with the same name \\nas another trait’s method, nor does Rust prevent you from implementing both traits on one type. It’s also possible to implement a method directly on the type with the same name as a method from a trait. \\nWhen calling methods with the same name, you’ll need to tell Rust \\nwhich one you want to use.

In this case, you need to rely on the dependent trait’s also being implemented. The trait you rely on is a supertrait of the trait you’re implementing.\\nFor example, let’s say we want to make an \\nOutlinePrint  trait with an \\noutline_print  method that will print a value framed in asterisks.

Therefore, we need to specify that the OutlinePrint  \\ntrait will work only for types that also implement Display  and provide the \\nfunctionality that OutlinePrint  needs. We can do that in the trait definition \\nby specifying OutlinePrint: Display . This technique is similar to adding \\na trait bound to the trait. Listing 19-30 shows an implementation of the \\nOutlinePrint  trait.\\nuse std::fmt;\\ntrait OutlinePrint: fmt::Display {\\n    fn outline_print(&self) {\\n        let output = self.to_string();\\n        let len = output.len();        println!(\"{}\", \"*\".repeat(len + 4));\\n        println!(\"*{}*\", \" \".repeat(len + 2));\\n        println!(\"* {} *\", output);\\n        println!(\"*{}*\", \" \".repeat(len + 2));\\n        println!(\"{}\", \"*\".repeat(len + 4));\\n    }\\n}\\nListing 19-30: Implementing the \\nOutlinePrint  trait that requires the functionality from Display\\nBecause we’ve specified that OutlinePrint  requires the Display  trait, we \\ncan use the to_string  function that is automatically implemented for any \\ntype that implements Display .

It’s possible to get around this restriction using the newtype pattern , which involves creating \\na new type in a tuple struct. (We covered tuple structs in “Using Tuple Structs Without Named Fields to Create Different Types” on page 84.) The tuple struct will have one field and be a thin wrapper around the type we want to implement a trait for. Then the wrapper type is local to our crate, and we can implement the trait on the wrapper. Newtype  is a \\nterm that originates from the Haskell programming language. There is no runtime performance penalty for using this pattern, and the wrapper type is elided at compile time.\\nAs an example, let’s say we want to implement \\nDisplay  on Vec<T> , which \\nthe orphan rule prevents us from doing directly because the Display  trait \\nand the Vec<T>  type are defined outside our crate. We can make a Wrapper  \\nstruct that holds an instance of Vec<T> ; then we can implement Display  on \\nWrapper  and use the Vec<T>  value, as shown in Listing 19-31.\\nuse std::fmt;\\nstruct Wrapper(Vec<String>);src/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Then we can use the functionality of the Display  type on Wrapper . \\nThe downside of using this technique is that Wrapper  is a new type, \\nso it doesn’t have the methods of the value it’s holding. We would have \\nto implement all the methods of Vec<T>  directly on Wrapper  such that the \\nmethods delegate to self.0 , which would allow us to treat Wrapper  exactly \\nlike a Vec<T> . If we wanted the new type to have every method the inner type \\nhas, implementing the Deref  trait (discussed in “Treating Smart Pointers \\nLike Regular References with the Deref  Trait” on page 311) on the Wrapper  \\nto return the inner type would be a solution. If we don’t want the Wrapper  \\ntype to have all the methods of the inner type—for example, to restrict the \\nWrapper  type’s behavior—we would have to implement just the methods \\nwe do want manually.\\nNow you know how the newtype pattern is used in relation to traits; it’s \\nalso a useful pattern even when traits are not involved. Let’s switch focus and look at some advanced ways to interact with Rust’s type system.\\nAdvanced Types\\nThe Rust type system has some features that we’ve mentioned in this book but haven’t yet discussed. We’ll start by discussing newtypes in general as we examine why newtypes are useful as types. Then we’ll move on to type aliases, a feature similar to newtypes but with slightly different semantics. We’ll also discuss the \\n! type and dynamically sized types.\\nnote  The next section assumes you’ve read “Using the Newtype Pattern to Implement External Traits on External Types” on page 439.\\nUsing the Newtype Pattern for Type Safety and Abstraction\\nThe newtype pattern is useful for tasks beyond those we’ve discussed so far, including statically enforcing that values are never confused and indicat -\\ning the units of a value. You saw an example of using newtypes to indicate units in Listing 19-23: recall that the \\nMillimeters  and Meters  structs wrapped \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 470}, page_content='Advanced Features    441u32 values in a newtype. If we wrote a function with a parameter of type \\nMillimeters , we couldn’t compile a program that accidentally tried to call \\nthat function with a value of type Meters  or a plain u32.\\nAnother use of the newtype pattern is in abstracting away some imple -\\nmentation details of a type: the new type can expose a public API that is \\ndifferent from the API of the private inner type if we used the new type directly to restrict the available functionality, for example.\\nNewtypes can also hide internal implementation. For example, we could \\nprovide a \\nPeople  type to wrap a HashMap<i32, String>  that stores a person’s ID \\nassociated with their name. Code using People  would only interact with the \\npublic API we provide, such as a method to add a name string to the People  \\ncollection; that code wouldn’t need to know that we assign an i32 ID to names \\ninternally. The newtype pattern is a lightweight way to achieve encapsulation to hide implementation details, which we discussed in “Encapsulation That Hides Implementation Details” on page 366.\\nCreating Type Synonyms with Type Aliases\\nAlong with the newtype pattern, Rust provides the ability to declare a type alias to give an existing type another name. For this we use the \\ntype keyword. \\nFor example, we can create the alias Kilometers  to i32 like so:\\ntype Kilometers = i32;\\nNow, the alias Kilometers  is a synonym  for i32; unlike the Millimeters  and \\nMeters  types we created in Listing 19-23, Kilometers  is not a separate, new \\ntype. Values that have the type Kilometers  will be treated the same as values \\nof type i32:\\ntype Kilometers = i32;\\nlet x: i32 = 5;\\nlet y: Kilometers = 5;\\nprintln!(\"x + y = {}\", x + y);\\nBecause Kilometers  and i32 are the same type, we can add values of both \\ntypes and we can pass Kilometers  values to functions that take i32 parameters. \\nHowever, using this method, we don’t get the type-checking benefits that we \\nget from the newtype pattern discussed earlier.\\nThe main use case for type synonyms is to reduce repetition. For \\nexample, we might have a lengthy type like this:\\nBox<Fn() + Send + \\'static>\\nWriting this lengthy type in function signatures and as type annotations \\nall over the code can be tiresome and error prone. Imagine having a project full of code like that in Listing 19-32.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Choosing a meaningful \\nname for a type alias can help communicate your intent as well ( thunk  is a \\nword for code to be evaluated at a later time, so it’s an appropriate name for \\na closure that gets stored).\\nType aliases are also commonly used with the Result<T, E>  type for reduc -\\ning repetition. Consider the std::io  module in the standard library. I/O oper -\\nations often return a Result<T, E>  to handle situations when operations fail to \\nwork. This library has a std::io::Error  struct that represents all possible I/O \\nerrors. Many of the functions in std::io  will be returning Result<T, E>  where \\nthe E is std::io::Error , such as these functions in the Write  trait:\\nuse std::io::Error;\\nuse std::fmt;\\npub trait Write {\\n    fn write(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<usize, Error>;\\n    fn flush(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error>;\\n    fn write_all(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<(), Error>;\\n    fn write_fmt(&mut self, fmt: fmt::Arguments) -> Result<(), Error>;\\n}\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 472}, page_content='Advanced Features    443The Result<..., Error>  is repeated a lot. As such, std::io  has this type of \\nalias declaration:\\ntype Result<T> = Result<T, std::io::Error>;\\nBecause this declaration is in the std::io  module, we can use the fully \\nqualified alias std::io::Result<T> —that is, a Result<T, E>  with the E filled \\nin as std::io::Error . The Write  trait function signatures end up looking \\nlike this:\\npub trait Write {\\n    fn write(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<usize>;\\n    fn flush(&mut self) -> Result<()>;\\n    fn write_all(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<()>;\\n    fn write_fmt(&mut self, fmt: Arguments) -> Result<()>;}\\nThe type alias helps in two ways: it makes code easier to write and  it \\ngives us a consistent interface across all of std::io . Because it’s an alias, it’s \\njust another Result<T, E> , which means we can use any methods that work \\non Result<T, E>  with it, as well as special syntax like the ? operator.\\nThe Never Type That Never Returns\\nRust has a special type named ! that’s known in type theory lingo as the \\nempty type  because it has no values. We prefer to call it the never type because \\nit stands in the place of the return type when a function will never return. \\nHere is an example:\\nfn bar() -> ! {\\n    // --snip--\\n}\\nThis code is read as “the function bar returns never.” Functions that \\nreturn never are called diverging functions . We can’t create values of the \\ntype ! so bar can never possibly return.\\nBut what use is a type you can never create values for? Recall the \\ncode from Listing 2-5 on page 28; we’ve reproduced part of it here in \\nListing  19-34.\\nlet guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {\\n    Ok(num) => num,\\n    Err(_) => continue,\\n};\\nListing 19-34: A match  with an arm that ends in continue\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 473}, page_content='444   Chapter 19At the time, we skipped over some details in this code. In “The match  \\nControl Flow Operator” on page 102, we discussed that match  arms must all \\nreturn the same type. So, for example, the following code doesn’t work:\\nlet guess = match guess.trim().parse() {\\n    Ok(_) => 5,\\n    Err(_) => \"hello\",\\n}\\nThe type of guess  in this code would have to be an integer and  a string, \\nand Rust requires that guess  have only one type. So what does continue  return? \\nHow were we allowed to return a u32 from one arm and have another arm \\nthat ends with continue  in Listing 19-34?\\nAs you might have guessed, continue  has a ! value. That is, when Rust \\ncomputes the type of guess , it looks at both match arms, the former with a \\nvalue of u32 and the latter with a ! value. Because ! can never have a value, \\nRust decides that the type of guess  is u32.\\nThe formal way of describing this behavior is that expressions of type ! \\ncan be coerced into any other type. We’re allowed to end this match  arm with \\ncontinue  because continue  doesn’t return a value; instead, it moves control \\nback to the top of the loop, so in the Err case, we never assign a value to guess .\\nThe never type is useful with the panic!  macro as well. Remember the \\nunwrap  function that we call on Option<T>  values to produce a value or panic? \\nHere is its definition:\\nimpl<T> Option<T> {    pub fn unwrap(self) -> T {\\n        match self {\\n            Some(val) => val,\\n            None => panic!(\"called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value\"),\\n        }    }\\n}\\nIn this code, the same thing happens as in the match  in Listing 19-34: \\nRust sees that val has the type T and panic!  has the type !, so the result of the \\noverall match  expression is T. This code works because panic!  doesn’t produce \\na value; it ends the program.

Sometimes referred \\nto as DSTs  or unsized types , these types let us write code using values whose \\nsize we can know only at runtime.\\nLet’s dig into the details of a dynamically sized type called str, which \\nwe’ve been using throughout the book. That’s right, not &str, but str on its \\nown is a DST. We can’t know how long the string is until runtime, meaning we can’t create a variable of type \\nstr, nor can we take an argument of type \\nstr. Consider the following code, which does not work:\\nlet s1: str = \"Hello there!\";\\nlet s2: str = \"How\\'s it going?\";\\nRust needs to know how much memory to allocate for any value of a par -\\nticular type, and all values of a type must use the same amount of memory. If \\nRust allowed us to write this code, these two str values would need to take up \\nthe same amount of space. But they have different lengths: s1 needs 12 bytes \\nof storage and s2 needs 15. This is why it’s not possible to create a variable \\nholding a dynamically sized type.\\nSo what do we do? In this case, you already know the answer: we make \\nthe types of s1 and s2 a &str rather than a str. Recall that in “String Slices” \\non page 75, we said the slice data structure stores the starting position and the length of the slice. \\nSo although a \\n&T is a single value that stores the memory address of \\nwhere the T is located, a &str is two  values: the address of the str and its \\nlength. As such, we can know the size of a &str value at compile time: it’s \\ntwice the length of a usize . That is, we always know the size of a &str, no \\nmatter how long the string it refers to is. In general, this is the way in which dynamically sized types are used in Rust: they have an extra bit of metadata that stores the size of the dynamic information. The golden rule of dynami -\\ncally sized types is that we must always put values of dynamically sized types behind a pointer of some kind.\\nWe can combine \\nstr with all kinds of pointers: for example, Box<str>  \\nor Rc<str> . In fact, you’ve seen this before but with a different dynamically \\nsized type: traits. Every trait is a dynamically sized type we can refer to by using the name of the trait. In “Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types” on page 369, we mentioned that to use traits as trait objects, we must put them behind a pointer, such as \\n&Trait  or Box<Trait>  \\n(Rc<Trait>  would work too).\\nTo work with DSTs, Rust has a particular trait called the Sized  trait to \\ndetermine whether or not a type’s size is known at compile time. This trait is automatically implemented for everything whose size is known at compile time. In addition, Rust implicitly adds a bound on \\nSized  to every generic \\nfunction. That is, a generic function definition like this.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

However, you can use the following special syntax to \\nrelax this restriction:\\nfn generic<T: ?Sized>(t: &T) {\\n    // --snip--\\n}\\nA trait bound on ?Sized  is the opposite of a trait bound on Sized : we \\nwould read this as “ T may or may not be Sized .” This syntax is only available \\nfor Sized , not any other traits.\\nAlso note that we switched the type of the t parameter from T to &T. \\nBecause the type might not be Sized , we need to use it behind some kind of \\npointer. In this case, we’ve chosen a reference.\\nNext, we’ll talk about functions and closures!\\nAdvanced Functions and Closures\\nFinally, we’ll explore some advanced features related to functions and clo -\\nsures, which include function pointers and returning closures.\\nFunction Pointers\\nWe’ve talked about how to pass closures to functions; you can also pass reg -\\nular functions to functions! This technique is useful when you want to pass \\na function you’ve already defined rather than defining a new closure. Doing this with function pointers will allow you to use functions as arguments to other functions. Functions coerce to the type \\nfn (with a lowercase f ), not to \\nbe confused with the Fn closure trait. The fn type is called a function pointer . \\nThe syntax for specifying that a parameter is a function pointer is similar to that of closures, as shown in Listing 19-35.\\nfn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {\\n    x + 1\\n}\\nfn do_twice(f: fn(i32) -> i32, arg: i32) -> i32 {\\n    f(arg) + f(arg)}src/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

We specify that the parameter f in \\ndo_twice  is an fn that takes one parameter of type i32 and returns an i32. \\nWe can then call f in the body of do_twice . In main, we can pass the function \\nname add_one  as the first argument to do_twice .\\nUnlike closures, fn is a type rather than a trait, so we specify fn as the \\nparameter type directly rather than declaring a generic type parameter \\nwith one of the Fn traits as a trait bound.\\nFunction pointers implement all three of the closure traits ( Fn, FnMut , \\nand FnOnce ), so you can always pass a function pointer as an argument for a \\nfunction that expects a closure. It’s best to write functions using a generic type and one of the closure traits so your functions can accept either func -\\ntions or closures.\\nAn example of where you would want to only accept \\nfn and not closures \\nis when interfacing with external code that doesn’t have closures: C functions can accept functions as arguments, but C doesn’t have closures.\\nAs an example of where you could use either a closure defined inline or \\na named function, let’s look at a use of \\nmap. To use the map function to turn a \\nvector of numbers into a vector of strings, we could use a closure, like this:\\nlet list_of_numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];\\nlet list_of_strings: Vec<String> = list_of_numbers\\n    .iter()\\n    .map(|i| i.to_string())\\n    .collect();\\nOr we could name a function as the argument to map instead of the \\nclosure, like this:\\nlet list_of_numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];\\nlet list_of_strings: Vec<String> = list_of_numbers\\n    .iter()\\n    .map(ToString::to_string)\\n    .collect();\\nNote that we must use the fully qualified syntax that we talked about \\nin “Advanced Traits” on page 430 because there are multiple functions \\navailable named to_string . Here, we’re using the to_string  function defined \\nin the ToString  trait, which the standard library has implemented for any type \\nthat implements Display .\\nSome people prefer this style, and some people prefer to use closures. They \\nend up compiling to the same code, so use whichever style is clearer to you.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 477}, page_content=\"448   Chapter 19Returning Closures\\nClosures are represented by traits, which means you can’t return closures \\ndirectly. In most cases where you might want to return a trait, you can instead use the concrete type that implements the trait as the return value of the function. But you can’t do that with closures because they don’t have a concrete type that is returnable; you’re not allowed to use the function pointer \\nfn as a return type, for example.\\nThe following code tries to return a closure directly, but it won’t compile:\\nfn returns_closure() -> Fn(i32) -> i32 {\\n    |x| x + 1\\n}\\nThe compiler error is as follows:\\nerror[E0277]: the trait bound `std::ops::Fn(i32) -> i32 + 'static:\\nstd::marker::Sized` is not satisfied\\n -->\\n  |\\n1 | fn returns_closure() -> Fn(i32) -> i32 {\\n  |                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `std::ops::Fn(i32) -> i32 + 'static` does not have a constant size known at compile-time\\n  |\\n  = help: the trait `std::marker::Sized` is not implemented for \\n`std::ops::Fn(i32) -> i32 + 'static`\\n  = note: the return type of a function must have a statically known size\\nThe error references the Sized  trait again! Rust doesn’t know how much \\nspace it will need to store the closure. We saw a solution to this problem ear -\\nlier. We can use a trait object:\\nfn returns_closure() -> Box<Fn(i32) -> i32> {    Box::new(|x| x + 1)\\n}\\nThis code will compile just fine. For more about trait objects, refer to \\n“Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types” on page 369.\\nSummary\\nWhew! Now you have some features of Rust in your toolbox that you won’t \\nuse often, but you’ll know they’re available in very particular circumstances.

Listen for TCP connections on a socket.\\n3. Parse a small number of HTTP requests.\\n4. Create a proper HTTP response.\\n5. Improve the throughput of our server with a thread pool.\\nBut before we get started, we should mention one detail: the method \\nwe’ll use won’t be the best way to build a web server with Rust. A number of \\nproduction-ready crates are available on https://crates.io/  that provide more \\ncomplete web server and thread pool implementations than we’ll build.\\nHowever, our intention in this chapter is to help you learn, not to take \\nthe easy route. Because Rust is a systems programming language, we can choose the level of abstraction we want to work with and can go to a lower level than is possible or practical in other languages. We’ll write the basic HTTP server and thread pool manually so you can learn the general ideas and techniques behind the crates you might use in the future.\\nBuilding a Single-Threaded Web Server\\nWe’ll start by getting a single-threaded web server working. Before we begin, let’s look at a quick overview of the protocols involved in building web servers. The details of these protocols are beyond the scope of this book, but a brief overview will give you the information you need.\\nThe two main protocols involved in web servers are the Hypertext Transfer \\nProtocol (HTTP)  and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) . Both protocols are \\nrequest-response  protocols, meaning that a client  initiates requests and a server  \\nlistens to the requests and provides a response to the client. The contents of those requests and responses are defined by the protocols.\\nTCP is the lower-level protocol that describes the details of how infor -\\nmation gets from one server to another but doesn’t specify what that informa -\\ntion is. HTTP builds on top of TCP by defining the contents of the requests and responses. It’s technically possible to use HTTP with other protocols, but in the vast majority of cases, HTTP sends its data over TCP. We’ll work with the raw bytes of TCP and HTTP requests and responses.\\nListening to the TCP Connection\\nOur web server needs to listen to a TCP connection, so that’s the first part we’ll work on. The standard library offers a \\nstd::net  module that lets us do \\nthis. Let’s make a new project in the usual fashion:\\n$ cargo new hello --bin\\n     Created binary (application) `hello` project\\n$ cd hello\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

In the address, the section before the colon is an IP \\naddress representing your computer (this is the same on every computer \\nand doesn’t represent the authors’ computer specifically), and 7878 is the port. We’ve chosen this port for two reasons: HTTP is normally accepted on this port, and 7878 is rust  typed on a telephone. \\nThe \\nbind function in this scenario works like the new function in that it \\nwill return a new TcpListener  instance. The reason the function is called bind \\nis that in networking, connecting to a port to listen to is known as “binding to a port.”\\nThe \\nbind function returns a Result<T, E> , which indicates that bind -\\ning might fail. For example, connecting to port 80 requires administrator privileges (nonadministrators can listen only on ports higher than 1024), so if we tried to connect to port 80 without being an administrator, binding wouldn’t work. As another example, binding wouldn’t work if we ran two instances of our program and so had two programs listening to the same port. Because we’re writing a basic server just for learning purposes, we won’t worry about handling these kinds of errors; instead, we use \\nunwrap  to \\nstop the program if errors happen.\\nThe incoming  method on TcpListener  returns an iterator that gives us \\na sequence of streams \\uf076  (more specifically, streams of type TcpStream ). A \\nsingle stream  represents an open connection between the client and the \\nserver. A connection  is the name for the full request and response process \\nin which a client connects to the server, the server generates a response, and the server closes the connection. As such, \\nTcpStream  will read from itself \\nto see what the client sent and then allow us to write our response to the stream. Overall, this \\nfor loop will process each connection in turn and pro -\\nduce a series of streams for us to handle.\\nFor now, our handling of the stream consists of calling unwrap  to termi -\\nnate our program if the stream has any errors \\uf077 ; if there aren’t any errors, \\nthe program prints a message \\uf078 .

The reason we might receive errors from \\nthe incoming  method when a client connects to the server is that we’re not \\nactually iterating over connections. Instead, we’re iterating over connection attempts . The connection might not be successful for a number of reasons, \\nmany of them operating system specific. For example, many operating sys -\\ntems have a limit to the number of simultaneous open connections they can support; new connection attempts beyond that number will produce an error until some of the open connections are closed.\\nLet’s try running this code! Invoke \\ncargo run  in the terminal and then \\nload 127.0.0.1:7878  in a web browser. The browser should show an error \\nmessage like “Connection reset,” because the server isn’t currently sending back any data.

When \\nstream  goes out of scope and is dropped at the end of the loop, the connec -\\ntion is closed as part of the drop implementation.

The reason is that the TcpStream  instance keeps track of what \\ndata it returns to us internally. It might read more data than we asked for and save that data for the next time we ask for data. It therefore needs to be \\nmut because its internal state might change; usually, we think of “reading” as \\nnot needing mutation, but in this case we need the mut keyword.\\nNext, we need to actually read from the stream. We do this in two steps: \\nFirst, we declare a buffer  on the stack to hold the data that is read in \\uf078 . \\nWe’ve made the buffer 512 bytes, which is big enough to hold the data of a basic request and sufficient for our purposes in this chapter. If we wanted to handle requests of an arbitrary size, buffer management would need to be more complicated; we’ll keep it simple for now. We pass the buffer to \\nstream \\n.read , which will read bytes from the TcpStream  and put them in the buffer \\uf079 .\\nSecond, we convert the bytes in the buffer to a string and print that \\nstring \\uf07a . The String::from_utf8_lossy  function takes a &[u8]  and produces a \\nString  from it. The “lossy” part of the name indicates the behavior of this \\nfunction when it sees an invalid UTF-8 sequence: it will replace the invalid sequence with � , the \\nU+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER . You might see replacement \\ncharacters for characters in the buffer that aren’t filled by request data.\\nLet’s try this code! Start the program and make a request in a web \\nbrowser again.

The only \\ndifferences are the status line and the filename. Let’s make the code more concise by pulling out those differences into separate \\nif and else lines that \\nwill assign the values of the status line and the filename to variables; we can then use those variables unconditionally in the code to read the file and write the response.

This makes it easier to see \\nthe difference between the two cases, and it means we have only one place to update the code if we want to change how the file reading and response writing work.

We now have a simple web server in approximately 40 lines of \\nRust code that responds to one request with a page of content and responds \\nto all other requests with a 404 response.\\nCurrently, our server runs in a single thread, meaning it can only serve \\none request at a time. Let’s examine how that can be a problem by simulat -\\ning some slow requests. Then we’ll fix it so our server can handle multiple requests at once.\\nTurning Our Single-Threaded Server into  \\na Multithreaded Server\\nRight now, the server will process each request in turn, meaning it won’t \\nprocess a second connection until the first is finished processing. If the server received more and more requests, this serial execution would be less and less optimal. If the server receives a request that takes a long time to pro -\\ncess, subsequent requests will have to wait until the long request is finished, even if the new requests can be processed quickly. We’ll need to fix this, but first, we’ll look at the problem in action.\\nSimulating a Slow Request in the Current Server Implementation\\nWe’ll look at how a slow-processing request can affect other requests made to our current server implementation.

We \\nadded an else if  after the if block to check for the request to /sleep  \\uf076. When \\nthat request is received, the server will sleep for 5 seconds \\uf077  before rendering \\nthe successful HTML page \\uf078 .\\nYou can see how primitive our server is: real libraries would handle the \\nrecognition of multiple requests in a much less verbose way!\\nStart the server using cargo run . Then open two browser windows: one \\nfor http://127.0.0.1:7878  and the other for http://127.0.0.1:7878/sleep . If you \\nenter the / URI a few times, as before, you’ll see it respond quickly. But if \\nyou enter /sleep  and then load / , you’ll see that / waits until sleep  has slept \\nfor its full 5 seconds before loading.\\nThere are multiple ways we could change how our web server works to \\navoid having more requests back up behind a slow request; the one we’ll \\nimplement is a thread pool.\\nImproving Throughput with a Thread Pool\\nA thread pool  is a group of spawned threads that are waiting and ready to \\nhandle a task. When the program receives a new task, it assigns one of the threads in the pool to the task, and that thread will process the task. The remaining threads in the pool are available to handle any other tasks that come in while the first thread is processing. When the first thread is done processing its task, it’s returned to the pool of idle threads, ready to handle a new task. A thread pool allows you to process connections concurrently, increasing the throughput of your server.\\nWe’ll limit the number of threads in the pool to a small number to \\nprotect us from Denial of Service (DoS) attacks; if we had our program create a new thread for each request as it came in, someone making 10 mil -\\nlion requests to our server could create havoc by using up all our server’s resources and grinding the processing of requests to a halt.\\nRather than spawning unlimited threads, we’ll have a fixed number of \\nthreads waiting in the pool. As requests come in, they’ll be sent to the pool for processing. The pool will maintain a queue of incoming requests. Each of the threads in the pool will pop off a request from this queue, handle the request, and then ask the queue for another request. With this design, we can process N  requests concurrently, where N  is the number of threads. \\nIf each thread is responding to a long-running request, subsequent requests can still back up in the queue, but we’ve increased the number of long-running requests we can handle before reaching that point.\\nThis technique is just one of many ways to improve the throughput of \\na web server. Other options you might explore are the fork/join model and the single-threaded async I/O model. If you’re interested in this topic, you can read more about other solutions and try to implement them in Rust; with a low-level language like Rust, all of these options are possible.\\nBefore we begin implementing a thread pool, let’s talk about what \\nusing the pool should look like.

We’ll write the code that calls the functions we want, and then we’ll look at errors from the compiler to determine what we should change next to get the code to work.\\nCode Structure If We Could Spawn a Thread for Each Request\\nFirst, let’s explore how our code might look if it did create a new thread for \\nevery connection. As mentioned earlier, this isn’t our final plan due to the problems with potentially spawning an unlimited number of threads, but it is a starting point. Listing 20-11 shows the changes to make to \\nmain to spawn \\na new thread to handle each stream within the for loop.\\nfn main() {\\n    let listener = TcpListener::bind(\"127.0.0.1:7878\").unwrap();\\n    for stream in listener.incoming() {\\n        let stream = stream.unwrap();\\n        thread::spawn(|| {\\n            handle_connection(stream);\\n        });\\n    }\\n}\\nListing 20-11: Spawning a new thread for each stream\\nAs you learned in Chapter 16, thread::spawn  will create a new thread \\nand then run the code in the closure in the new thread. If you run this \\ncode and load /sleep  in your browser, then / in two more browser tabs, you’ll \\nindeed see that the requests to / don’t have to wait for /sleep  to finish. But as \\nwe mentioned, this will eventually overwhelm the system because you’d be making new threads without any limit.\\nCreating a Similar Interface for a Finite Number of Threads\\nWe want our thread pool to work in a similar, familiar way so that switch -\\ning from threads to a thread pool doesn’t require large changes to the \\ncode that uses our API. Listing 20-12 shows the hypothetical interface for a \\nThreadPool  struct we want to use instead of thread::spawn .\\nfn main() {\\n    let listener = TcpListener::bind(\"127.0.0.1:7878\").unwrap();\\n    \\uf075 let pool = ThreadPool::new(4);\\n    for stream in listener.incoming() {        let stream = stream.unwrap();src/main.rs\\nsrc/main.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Ignoring the warning for a moment, \\nthe error occurs because we don’t have an execute  method on ThreadPool . \\nRecall from “Creating a Similar Interface for a Finite Number of Threads” on \\npage 462 that we decided our thread pool should have an interface similar to \\nthread::spawn . In addition, we’ll implement the execute  function so it takes \\nthe closure it’s given and gives it to an idle thread in the pool to run.\\nWe’ll define the execute  method on ThreadPool  to take a closure as a \\nparameter. Recall from “Storing Closures Using Generic Parameters and the \\nFn Traits” on page 264 that we can take closures as parameters with \\nthree different traits: Fn, FnMut , and FnOnce . We need to decide which kind \\nof closure to use here. We know we’ll end up doing something similar to the standard library \\nthread::spawn  implementation, so we can look at what \\nbounds the signature of thread::spawn  has on its parameter. The documenta -\\ntion shows us the following:\\npub fn spawn<F, T>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<T>\\n    where\\n        F: FnOnce() -> T + Send + 'static,\\n        T: Send + 'static\\nThe F type parameter is the one we’re concerned with here; the T type \\nparameter is related to the return value, and we’re not concerned with that. \\nWe can see that spawn  uses FnOnce  as the trait bound on F. This is probably \\nwhat we want as well, because we’ll eventually pass the argument we get in \\nexecute  to spawn . We can be further confident that FnOnce  is the trait we \\nwant to use because the thread for running a request will only execute that request’s closure one time, which matches the \\nOnce in FnOnce .\\nThe F type parameter also has the trait bound Send and the lifetime \\nbound 'static , which are useful in our situation: we need Send to transfer \\nthe closure from one thread to another and 'static  because we don’t know \\nhow long the thread will take to execute. Let’s create an execute  method on \\nThreadPool  that will take a generic parameter of type F with these bounds:\\nimpl ThreadPool {\\n    // --snip--\\n    pub fn execute<F>(&self, f: F)\\n        where\\n            F: FnOnce()\\uf075 + Send + 'static    {\\n    }\\n}src/lib.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir\"),\n",

Just like function defi -\\nnitions, the return type can be omitted from the signature, but even if we \\nhave no parameters, we still need the parentheses.\\nAgain, this is the simplest implementation of the execute  method: it does \\nnothing, but we’re trying only to make our code compile.

The standard \\nlibrary provides thread::spawn  as a way to create threads, and thread::spawn  \\nexpects to get some code the thread should run as soon as the thread is created. However, in our case, we want to create the threads and have them wait for code that we’ll send later. The standard library’s implementation of \\nthreads doesn’t include any way to do that; we have to implement it manually.\\nWe’ll implement this behavior by introducing a new data structure \\nbetween the \\nThreadPool  and the threads that will manage this new behavior. src/lib.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Each Worker  will store a single \\nJoinHandle<()>  instance.

This trait has the one \\nmethod call_box  \\uf076, which is similar to the call methods on the other Fn* \\ntraits except that it takes self: Box<Self>  to take ownership of self and move \\nthe value out of the Box<T> .\\nNext, we implement the FnBox  trait for any type F that implements the \\nFnOnce()  trait \\uf077 . Effectively, this means that any FnOnce()  closures can use \\nour call_box  method. The implementation of call_box  uses (*self)()  to move \\nthe closure out of the Box<T>  and call the closure \\uf078 .\\nWe now need our Job type alias to be a Box of anything that implements \\nour new trait FnBox  \\uf079.

This ensures that the lock is \\nheld during the call to recv, but it is released before the call to job.call_box() , \\nallowing multiple requests to be serviced concurrently.\\nGraceful Shutdown and Cleanup\\nThe code in Listing 20-21 is responding to requests asynchronously through \\nthe use of a thread pool, as we intended. We get some warnings about the \\nworkers , id, and thread  fields that we’re not using in a direct way that reminds \\nus we’re not cleaning up anything. When we use the less elegant ctrl -C \\nmethod to halt the main thread, all other threads are stopped immediately as well, even if they’re in the middle of serving a request.\\nNow we’ll implement the \\nDrop trait to call join on each of the threads in \\nthe pool so they can finish the requests they’re working on before closing. Then we’ll implement a way to tell the threads they should stop accept -\\ning new requests and shut down. To see this code in action, we’ll modify our server to accept only two requests before gracefully shutting down its thread pool.\\nImplementing the Drop Trait on ThreadPool\\nLet’s start with implementing Drop on our thread pool. When the pool is \\ndropped, our threads should all join to make sure they finish their work. Listing 20-23 shows a first attempt at a \\nDrop implementation; this code won’t \\nquite work yet.\\nimpl Drop for ThreadPool {\\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\\n        \\uf075 for worker in &mut self.workers {            \\uf076 println!(\"Shutting down worker {}\", worker.id);\\n            \\uf077 worker.thread.join().unwrap();\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\nListing 20-23: Joining each thread when the thread pool goes out of scope\\nFirst, we loop through each of the thread pool workers  \\uf075. We use &mut \\nfor this because self is a mutable reference, and we also need to be able \\nto mutate worker . For each worker, we print a message saying that this par -\\nticular worker is shutting down \\uf076 , and then we call join on that worker’s \\nthread \\uf077 . If the call to join fails, we use unwrap  to make Rust panic and go \\ninto an ungraceful shutdown.src/lib.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

To solve \\nthis issue, we need to move the thread out of the Worker  instance that owns \\nthread  so join can consume the thread. We did this in Listing 17-15 on \\npage 379: if Worker  holds an Option<thread::JoinHandle<()>  instead, we can \\ncall the take method on the Option  to move the value out of the Some variant \\nand leave a None variant in its place. In other words, a Worker  that is running \\nwill have a Some variant in thread , and when we want to clean up a Worker , \\nwe’ll replace Some with None so the Worker  doesn’t have a thread to run.\\nSo we know we want to update the definition of Worker  like this:\\nstruct Worker {\\n    id: usize,\\n    thread: Option<thread::JoinHandle<()>>,\\n}\\nNow let’s lean on the compiler to find the other places that need to \\nchange.

We mentioned earlier that \\nwe intended to call take on the Option  value to move thread  out of worker .

We’re using if let  to destructure the \\nSome and get the thread \\uf075 ; then we call join on the thread \\uf076 . If a worker’s \\nthread is already None, we know that worker has already had its thread \\ncleaned up, so nothing happens in that case.\\nSignaling to the Threads to Stop Listening for Jobs\\nWith all the changes we’ve made, our code compiles without any warn -\\nings. But the bad news is that this code doesn’t function the way we want it \\nto yet. The key is the logic in the closures run by the threads of the Worker  \\ninstances: at the moment, we call join, but that won’t shut down the threads \\nbecause they loop forever looking for jobs. If we try to drop our ThreadPool  \\nwith our current implementation of drop, the main thread will block forever \\nwaiting for the first thread to finish.\\nTo fix this problem, we’ll modify the threads so they listen for either a Job \\nto run or a signal that they should stop listening and exit the infinite loop.

If we used a single loop to iterate through each \\nworker, on the first iteration, a terminate message would be sent down the channel and \\njoin called on the first worker’s thread. If that first worker was \\nbusy processing a request at that moment, the second worker would pick up the terminate message from the channel and shut down. We would be left waiting on the first worker to shut down, but it never would because the sec -\\nond thread picked up the terminate message. Deadlock!\\nTo prevent this scenario, we first put all of our \\nTerminate  messages on the \\nchannel in one loop; then we join on all the threads in another loop. Each worker will stop receiving requests on the channel once it gets a terminate message. So, we can be sure that if we send the same number of terminate messages as there are workers, each worker will receive a terminate message before \\njoin is called on its thread.\\nTo see this code in action, let’s modify main to accept only two requests \\nbefore gracefully shutting down the server, as shown in Listing 20-26.\\nfn main() {\\n    let listener = TcpListener::bind(\"127.0.0.1:7878\").unwrap();\\n    let pool = ThreadPool::new(4);\\n    for stream in listener.incoming().take(2) {\\n        let stream = stream.unwrap();\\n        pool.execute(|| {\\n            handle_connection(stream);\\n        });\\n    }\\n    println!(\"Shutting down.\");\\n}\\nListing 20-26: Shut down the server after serving two requests by exiting the loop\\nYou wouldn’t want a real-world web server to shut down after serving \\nonly two requests.

Worker 0 had not yet received the terminate message, so the main thread blocked waiting for worker 0 to finish. In the meantime, each of the workers received the ter -\\nmination messages.

These traits don’t have sensible default \\nbehavior, so it’s up to you to implement them in the way that makes sense for what you’re trying to accomplish.\\nAn example of a trait that can’t be derived is \\nDisplay , which handles \\nformatting for end users. You should always consider the appropriate way to display a type to an end user. What parts of the type should an end user be allowed to see? What parts would they find relevant? What format of the data would be most relevant to them? The Rust compiler doesn’t have this insight, so it can’t provide appropriate default behavior for you.\\nThe list of derivable traits provided in this appendix is not comprehen -\\nsive: libraries can implement \\nderive  for their own traits, making the list of \\ntraits you can use derive  with truly open-ended. Implementing derive  involves \\nusing a procedural macro, which is covered in Appendix D.\\nDebug for Programmer Output\\nThe Debug  trait enables debug formatting in format strings, which you indi -\\ncate by adding :? within {} placeholders.\\nThe Debug  trait allows you to print instances of a type for debugging \\npurposes, so you and other programmers using your type can inspect an instance at a particular point in a program’s execution.\\nThe \\nDebug  trait is required, for example, in use of the assert_eq!  macro. \\nThis macro prints the values of instances given as arguments if the equality assertion fails so programmers can see why the two instances weren’t equal.\\nPartialEq and Eq for Equality Comparisons\\nThe PartialEq  trait allows you to compare instances of a type to check for \\nequality and enables use of the == and != operators.\\nDeriving PartialEq  implements the eq method. When PartialEq  is \\nderived on structs, two instances are equal only if all fields are equal, and the instances are not equal if any fields are not equal. When derived on enums, each variant is equal to itself and not equal to the other variants.\\nThe \\nPartialEq  trait is required, for example, with the use of the assert_eq!  \\nmacro, which needs to be able to compare two instances of a type for equality.\\nThe Eq trait has no methods. Its purpose is to signal that for every value \\nof the annotated type, the value is equal to itself. The Eq trait can only be \\napplied to types that also implement PartialEq , although not all types that \\nimplement PartialEq  can implement Eq. One example of this is floating point \\nnumber types: the implementation of floating point numbers states that two instances of the not-a-number (\\nNaN) value are not equal to each other.\\nAn example of when Eq is required is for keys in a HashMap<K,V>  so the \\nHashMap<K,V>  can tell whether two keys are the same.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

A type that implements PartialOrd  can be used with the <, >, <=, \\nand >= operators. You can only apply the PartialOrd  trait to types that also \\nimplement PartialEq .\\nDeriving PartialOrd  implements the partial_cmp  method, which returns \\nan Option<Ordering>  that will be None when the values given don’t produce an \\nordering. An example of a value that doesn’t produce an ordering, even \\nthough most values of that type can be compared, is the not-a-number ( NaN) \\nfloating point value. Calling partial_cmp  with any floating point number and \\nthe NaN floating point value will return None.\\nWhen derived on structs, PartialOrd  compares two instances by com -\\nparing the value in each field in the order in which the fields appear in the struct definition. When derived on enums, variants of the enum declared earlier in the enum definition are considered less than the vari -\\nants listed later.\\nThe\\n PartialOrd  trait is required, for example, for the gen_range  method \\nfrom the rand crate that generates a random value in the range specified by \\na low value and a high value.\\nThe Ord trait allows you to know that for any two values of the annotated \\ntype, a valid ordering will exist. The Ord trait implements the cmp method, \\nwhich returns an Ordering  rather than an Option<Ordering>  because a valid \\nordering will always be possible. You can only apply the Ord trait to types \\nthat also implement PartialOrd  and Eq (and Eq requires PartialEq ). When \\nderived on structs and enums, cmp behaves the same way as the derived \\nimplementation for partial_cmp  does with PartialOrd .\\nAn example of when Ord is required is when storing values in a BTreeSet<T> , \\na data structure that stores data based on the sort order of the values.\\nClone and Copy for Duplicating Values\\nThe Clone  trait allows you to explicitly create a deep copy of a value, and the \\nduplication process might involve running arbitrary code and copying heap data. See “Ways That Variables and Data Interact: \\nClone ” on page 65 for \\nmore information on Clone .\\nDeriving Clone  implements the clone  method, which when implemented \\nfor the whole type, calls clone  on each of the parts of the type. This means \\nall the fields or values in the type must also implement Clone  to derive Clone .\\nAn example of when Clone  is required is when calling the to_vec  method \\non a slice. The slice doesn’t own the type instances it contains, but the vector returned from \\nto_vec  will need to own its instances, so to_vec  calls clone  on \\neach item. Thus, the type stored in the slice must implement Clone .\\nThe Copy trait allows you to duplicate a value by only copying bits stored \\non the stack; no arbitrary code is necessary.

You can \\nonly apply the Copy trait to types that also implement Clone , because a type \\nthat implements Copy has a trivial implementation of Clone  that performs the \\nsame task as Copy.\\nThe Copy trait is rarely required; types that implement Copy have opti -\\nmizations available, meaning you don’t have to call clone , which makes the \\ncode more concise.\\nEverything possible with Copy you can also accomplish with Clone , but \\nthe code might be slower or have to use clone  in places.\\nHash for Mapping a Value to a Value of Fixed Size\\nThe Hash trait allows you to take an instance of a type of arbitrary size and \\nmap that instance to a value of fixed size using a hash function. Deriving \\nHash implements the hash method. The derived implementation of the hash \\nmethod combines the result of calling hash on each of the parts of the type, \\nmeaning all fields or values must also implement Hash to derive Hash.\\nAn example of when Hash is required is in storing keys in a HashMap<K,V>  \\nto store data efficiently.\\nDefault for Default Values\\nThe Default  trait allows you to create a default value for a type. Deriving \\nDefault  implements the default  function. The derived implementation of the \\ndefault  function calls the default  function on each part of the type, meaning \\nall fields or values in the type must also implement Default  to derive Default .\\nThe Default::default  function is commonly used in combination with \\nthe struct update syntax discussed in “Creating Instances from Other Instances with Struct Update Syntax” on page 84. You can customize a few fields of a struct and then set and use a default value for the rest of the fields by using \\n..Default::default() .\\nThe Default  trait is required when you use the method unwrap_or_default  \\non Option<T>  instances, for example.

              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 531}, page_content='502   Appendix DThe Difference Between Macros and Functions\\nFundamentally, macros are a way of writing code that writes other code, \\nwhich is known as metaprogramming . In Appendix C, we discussed the derive  \\nattribute, which generates an implementation of various traits for you. We’ve also used the \\nprintln!  and vec! macros throughout the book. All of these \\nmacros expand  to produce more code than the code you’ve written manually.\\nMetaprogramming is useful for reducing the amount of code you have \\nto write and maintain, which is also one of the roles of functions. However, macros have some additional powers that functions don’t have.\\nA function signature must declare the number and type of param -\\neters the function has. Macros, on the other hand, can take a variable number of parameters: we can call \\nprintln!(\"hello\")  with one argument or \\nprintln!(\"hello {}\", name)  with two arguments. Also, macros are expanded \\nbefore the compiler interprets the meaning of the code, so a macro can, for example, implement a trait on a given type. A function can’t, because it gets called at runtime and a trait needs to be implemented at compile time.\\nThe downside to implementing a macro instead of a function is that \\nmacro definitions are more complex than function definitions because you’re writing Rust code that writes Rust code. Due to this indirection, macro definitions are generally more difficult to read, understand, and maintain than function definitions.\\nAnother difference between macros and functions is that macro defini -\\ntions aren’t namespaced within modules like function definitions are. To prevent unexpected name clashes when using external crates, you have to explicitly bring the macros into the scope of your project at the same time as you bring the external crate into scope, using the \\n#[macro_use]  annotation. \\nThe following example would bring all the macros defined in the serde  crate \\ninto the scope of the current crate:\\n#[macro_use]\\nextern crate serde;\\nIf extern crate  was able to bring macros into scope by default without \\nthis explicit annotation, you would be prevented from using two crates that \\nhappened to define macros with the same name. In practice, this conflict doesn’t occur often, but the more crates you use, the more likely it is.\\nThere is one last important difference between macros and functions: \\nyou must define or bring macros into scope before  you call them in a file, \\nwhereas you can define functions anywhere and call them anywhere.\\nDeclarative Macros with macro_rules! for  \\nGeneral Metaprogramming\\nThe most widely used form of macros in Rust are declarative macros . These \\nare also sometimes referred to as macros by example , macro_rules!  macros , \\nor just plain macros . At their core, declarative macros allow you to write \\nsomething similar to a Rust match  expression. As discussed in Chapter 6, \\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Macros also compare a value to patterns \\nthat have code associated with them; in this situation, the value is the literal Rust source code passed to the macro, the patterns are compared with the structure of that source code, and the code associated with each pattern is the code that replaces the code passed to the macro. This all happens during compilation.\\nTo define a macro, you use the \\nmacro_rules!  construct. Let’s explore how \\nto use macro_rules!  by looking at how the vec! macro is defined. Chapter 8 \\ncovered how we can use the vec! macro to create a new vector with particular \\nvalues. For example, the following macro creates a new vector with three integers inside:\\nlet v: Vec<u32> = vec![1, 2, 3];\\nWe could also use the vec! macro to make a vector of two integers or a \\nvector of five string slices. We wouldn’t be able to use a function to do the same because we wouldn’t know the number or type of values up front.\\nLet’s look at a slightly simplified definition of the \\nvec! macro in \\nListing  D-1.\\nu #[macro_export]\\nv macro_rules! vec {\\n    w ( $( $x:expr ),* ) => {\\n        {            let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();\\n            x $(\\n                y temp_vec.push($xz );\\n            )*\\n            { temp_vec\\n        }    };\\n}\\nListing D-1: A simplified version of the \\nvec! macro definition\\nNote  The actual definition of the vec! macro in the standard library includes code to pre\\xad\\nallocate the correct amount of memory up front. That code is an optimization that we \\ndon’t include here to make the example simpler.\\nThe #[macro_export]  annotation u  indicates that this macro should be \\nmade available whenever the crate in which we’re defining the macro is imported. Without this annotation, even if someone depending on this crate uses the \\n#[macro_use]  annotation, the macro wouldn’t be brought into scope.\\nWe then start the macro definition with macro_rules!  and the name of the \\nmacro we’re defining without  the exclamation mark v . The name, in this case \\nvec, is followed by curly brackets denoting the body of the macro definition.\\nThe structure in the vec! body is similar to the structure of a match  expres -\\nsion.

More complex macros will have more than one arm.\\nValid pattern syntax in macro definitions is different than the pattern \\nsyntax covered in Chapter 18 because macro patterns are matched against Rust code structure rather than values. Let’s walk through what the pieces of the pattern in Listing D-1 mean; for the full macro pattern syntax, see the reference at https://doc.rust \\xadlang.org/stable/reference/macros.html .\\nFirst, a set of parentheses encompasses the whole pattern. Next comes \\na dollar sign (\\n$) followed by a set of parentheses, which captures values that \\nmatch the pattern within the parentheses for use in the replacement code. Within \\n$() is $x:expr , which matches any Rust expression and gives the \\nexpression the name $x.\\nThe comma following $() indicates that a literal comma separator char -\\nacter could optionally appear after the code that matches the code captured in \\n$(). The * following the comma specifies that the pattern matches zero or \\nmore of whatever precedes the *.\\nWhen we call this macro with vec![1, 2, 3]; , the $x pattern matches \\nthree times with the three expressions 1, 2, and 3.\\nNow let’s look at the pattern in the body of the code associated with \\nthis arm: the temp_vec.push()  code y within the $()* part x{  is generated \\nfor each part that matches $() in the pattern, zero or more times depend -\\ning on how many times the pattern matches. The $x z is replaced with each \\nexpression matched.

We need a macro to generate code at compile time.\\nThe next step is to define the procedural macro. At the time of this \\nwriting, procedural macros need to be in their own crate. Eventually, this restriction might be lifted. The convention for structuring crates and macro crates is as follows: for a crate named \\nfoo, a custom derive procedural macro \\ncrate is called foo_derive . Let’s start a new crate called hello_macro_derive  inside \\nour hello_macro  project:\\n$ cargo new hello_macro_derive --lib\\nOur two crates are tightly related, so we create the procedural macro \\ncrate within the directory of our hello_macro  crate.

The two crates will need to \\nbe published separately, and programmers using these crates will need to add both as dependencies and bring them both into scope. We could instead have the \\nhello_macro  crate use hello_macro_derive  as a dependency \\nand reexport the procedural macro code. But the way we’ve structured the project makes it possible for programmers to use \\nhello_macro  even if they \\ndon’t want the derive  functionality.\\nWe need to declare the hello_macro_derive  crate as a procedural macro \\ncrate. We’ll also need functionality from the syn and quote  crates, as you’ll \\nsee in a moment, so we need to add them as dependencies. Add the follow -\\ning to the Cargo.toml  file for hello_macro_derive :\\n[lib]\\nproc-macro = true\\n[dependencies]\\nsyn = \"0.11.11\"\\nquote = \"0.3.15\"\\nTo start defining the procedural macro, place the code in Listing D-3 \\ninto your src/lib.rs  file for the hello_macro_derive  crate. Note that this code \\nwon’t compile until we add a definition for the impl_hello_macro  function.hello_macro_derive \\n/Cargo.toml\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

What you choose to do in the place where the \\nimpl_hello_macro  function is called | will be different \\ndepending on your procedural macro’s purpose.\\nWe’ve introduced three new crates: proc_macro  u, syn v (available from \\nhttps://crates.io/crates/syn/ ), and quote  w (available from https://crates.io/crates/\\nquote/ ). The proc_macro  crate comes with Rust, so we didn’t need to add that \\nto the dependencies in Cargo.toml . The proc_macro  crate allows us to convert \\nRust code into a string containing that Rust code. The syn crate parses Rust \\ncode from a string into a data structure that we can perform operations on. The \\nquote  crate takes syn data structures and turns them back into Rust code. \\nThese crates make it much simpler to parse any sort of Rust code we might want to handle: writing a full parser for Rust code is no simple task.\\nThe \\nhello_macro_derive  function y will get called when a user of our \\nlibrary specifies #[derive(HelloMacro)]  on a type. The reason is that we’ve \\nannotated the hello_macro_derive  function here with proc_macro_derive  x and \\nspecified the name, HelloMacro , which matches our trait name; that’s the \\nconvention most procedural macros follow.\\nThis function first converts the input  from a TokenStream  to a String  by \\ncalling to_string  z. This String  is a string representation of the Rust code \\nfor which we are deriving HelloMacro . In the example in Listing D-2, s will \\nhave the String  value struct Pancakes;  because that is the Rust code we \\nadded the #[derive(HelloMacro)]  annotation to.hello_macro \\n_derive/src/lib.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'Rust.pdf', 'page': 537}, page_content='508   Appendix DNote  At the time of this writing, you can only convert a TokenStream  to a string. A richer \\nAPI will exist in the future.\\nNow we need to parse the Rust code String  into a data structure that \\nwe can then interpret and perform operations on. This is where syn comes \\ninto play. The parse_derive_input  function in syn takes a String  and returns a \\nDeriveInput  struct representing the parsed Rust code { . The following code \\nshows the relevant parts of the DeriveInput  struct we get from parsing the \\nstring struct Pancakes; :\\nDeriveInput {\\n    // --snip--\\n    ident: Ident(\\n        \"Pancakes\"\\n    ),    body: Struct(\\n        Unit\\n    )\\n}\\nThe fields of this struct show that the Rust code we’ve parsed is a unit \\nstruct with the ident  (identifier, meaning the name) of Pancakes . There are \\nmore fields on this struct for describing all sorts of Rust code; check the \\nsyn documentation for DeriveInput  at https://docs.rs/syn/0.11.11/syn/struct  \\n.DeriveInput.html  for more information.\\nAt this point, we haven’t defined the impl_hello_macro  function | , which \\nis where we’ll build the new Rust code we want to include. But before we do, \\nnote that the last part of this hello_macro_derive  function uses the parse  func -\\ntion from the quote  crate to turn the output of the impl_hello_macro  function \\nback into a TokenStream  }. The returned TokenStream  is added to the code that \\nour crate users write, so when they compile their crate, they’ll get extra func -\\ntionality that we provide.\\nYou might have noticed that we’re calling unwrap  to panic if the calls to \\nthe parse_derive_input  or parse  functions fail here. Panicking on errors is \\nnecessary in procedural macro code because proc_macro_derive  functions \\nmust return TokenStream  rather than Result  to conform to the procedural \\nmacro API. We’ve chosen to simplify this example by using unwrap ; in pro -\\nduction code, you should provide more specific error messages about what went wrong by using \\npanic!  or expect .\\nNow that we have the code to turn the annotated Rust code from a \\nTokenStream  into a String  and a DeriveInput  instance, let’s generate the code \\nthat implements the HelloMacro  trait on the annotated type:\\nfn impl_hello_macro(ast: &syn::DeriveInput) -> quote::Tokens {\\n    u let name = &ast.ident;\\n    v quote! {hello_macro_derive \\n/src/lib.rs\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

My name is {}\", stringify!z (#name));\\n            }        }\\n    }}\\nWe get an Ident  struct instance containing the name (identifier) of the \\nannotated type using ast.ident  u. The code in Listing D-2 specifies that the \\nname will be Ident(\"Pancakes\") .\\nThe quote!  macro v lets us write the Rust code that we want to return \\nand convert it into quote::Tokens . This macro also provides some very cool \\ntemplating mechanics; we can write #name , and quote!  will replace it with the \\nvalue in the variable named name. You can even do some repetition similar \\nto the way regular macros work. Check out the quote  crate’s docs at https://\\ndocs.rs/quote/  for a thorough introduction.\\nWe want our procedural macro to generate an implementation of our \\nHelloMacro  trait for the type the user annotated, which we can get by using \\n#name  w. The trait implementation has one function, hello_macro  x, whose \\nbody contains the functionality we want to provide: printing Hello, Macro! \\nMy name is  and then the name of the annotated type y .\\nThe stringify!  macro used here z is built into Rust. It takes a Rust \\nexpression, such as 1 + 2 , and at compile time turns the expression into \\na string literal, such as \"1 + 2\" . This is different from format!  or println! , \\nwhich evaluate the expression and then turn the result into a String . There \\nis a possibility that the #name  input might be an expression to print literally, \\nso we use stringify! . Using stringify!  also saves an allocation by converting \\n#name  to a string literal at compile time.\\nAt this point, cargo build  should complete successfully in both hello_macro  \\nand hello_macro_derive . Let’s hook up these crates to the code in Listing D-2 \\nto see the procedural macro in action! Create a new binary project in your \\nprojects  directory using cargo new --bin pancakes . We need to add hello_macro  \\nand hello_macro_derive  as dependencies in the pancakes  crate’s Cargo.toml . If \\nyou’re publishing your versions of hello_macro  and hello_macro_derive  to https://\\ncrates.io/ , they would be regular dependencies; if not, you can specify them as \\npath dependencies as follows:\\n[dependencies]\\nhello_macro = { path = \"../hello_macro\" }\\nhello_macro_derive = { path = \"../hello_macro/hello_macro_derive\" }\\nPut the code from Listing D-2 into src/main.rs , and run cargo run : it \\nshould print Hello, Macro! My name is Pancakes!  The implementation of \\nthe HelloMacro  trait from the procedural macro was included without the \\npancakes  crate needing to implement it; the #[derive(HelloMacro)]  added the \\ntrait implementation.\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Rust offers the option of control over low-level details (such as memory usage) in combination with high-level ergo-nomics, eliminating the hassle traditionally associated with low-level languages.\\nIn The Rust Programming Language, two members of \\nthe Rust Core Team will show you how to take full advantage of Rust’s features—from installation to creating your own robust and scalable programs. You’ll begin with the basics, like creating functions, choosing data types, and binding variables. Then you’ll move on to more advanced concepts, such as:\\n• Ownership and borrowing, lifetimes, and traits• Using Rust’s memory safety guarantees to build fast, \\nsafe programs\\n• Testing, error handling, and effective refactoring• Generics, smart pointers, multithreading, trait objects, \\nand advanced pattern matchingSHELVE IN: PROGRAMMING\\nLANGUAGES/RUST• Using Cargo, Rust’s built-in package manager, to \\nbuild, test, and document your code and manage \\ndependencies\\n• How best to use Rust’s advanced compiler with \\ncompiler-led programming techniques\\nYou’ll find plenty of code examples throughout the book as well as three chapters dedicated to building complete projects designed to test your learning: a number guessing game, a Rust implementation of a command line tool, and a multithreaded server.\\nABOUT THE AUTHORS\\nSteve Klabnik  leads the Rust documentation team and is \\none of Rust’s core developers. A frequent speaker and prolific open source contributor, he previously worked on projects such as Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

            "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mRust is considered special and unique among programming languages due to the following key features and characteristics:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Memory Safety**: Rust's most distinctive feature is its emphasis on memory safety without the need for a garbage collector. It achieves this through the concept of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, which prevent common programming errors such as null pointer dereferencing, data races, and memory leaks.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Concurrency**: Rust provides built-in support for concurrent programming through its ownership system. The ownership model ensures thread safety at compile time, allowing developers to write concurrent code that is free from data races.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Performance**: Rust is designed to offer high performance similar to low-level languages like C and C++. It achieves this by providing fine-grained control over memory layout and allocation, enabling efficient code generation.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Zero-cost Abstractions**: Rust allows developers to write high-level abstractions without incurring any runtime overhead. This is achieved through its ownership and borrowing system, which is enforced at compile time rather than runtime.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Safety**: Rust guarantees memory safety and thread safety through its strict compiler checks. The compiler enforces rules at compile time that prevent common bugs and vulnerabilities, making Rust code robust and secure.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Community**: Rust has a vibrant and welcoming community that actively contributes to the language's development. The Rust community is known for its focus on inclusivity, diversity, and providing a supportive environment for learning and collaboration.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Tooling**: Rust comes with a powerful toolchain, including Cargo (package manager), rustc (compiler), and rustup (toolchain manager). These tools streamline the development process and make it easy to manage dependencies, build projects, and ensure code quality.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Expressiveness**: Rust combines low-level control with high-level abstractions, allowing developers to write expressive and concise code. Its functional programming features, pattern matching, and type system make it a versatile language for a wide range of applications.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, Rust's combination of memory safety, performance, concurrency support, safety guarantees, community engagement, robust tooling, and expressiveness sets it apart from other programming languages and makes it a compelling choice for systems programming and beyond.\u001b[0m\n",

It achieves this through the concept of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, which prevent common programming errors such as null pointer dereferencing, data races, and memory leaks.\\n\\n2. **Concurrency**: Rust provides built-in support for concurrent programming through its ownership system. The ownership model ensures thread safety at compile time, allowing developers to write concurrent code that is free from data races.\\n\\n3. **Performance**: Rust is designed to offer high performance similar to low-level languages like C and C++. It achieves this by providing fine-grained control over memory layout and allocation, enabling efficient code generation.\\n\\n4. **Zero-cost Abstractions**: Rust allows developers to write high-level abstractions without incurring any runtime overhead. This is achieved through its ownership and borrowing system, which is enforced at compile time rather than runtime.\\n\\n5. **Safety**: Rust guarantees memory safety and thread safety through its strict compiler checks. The compiler enforces rules at compile time that prevent common bugs and vulnerabilities, making Rust code robust and secure.\\n\\n6. **Community**: Rust has a vibrant and welcoming community that actively contributes to the language's development. The Rust community is known for its focus on inclusivity, diversity, and providing a supportive environment for learning and collaboration.\\n\\n7. **Tooling**: Rust comes with a powerful toolchain, including Cargo (package manager), rustc (compiler), and rustup (toolchain manager). These tools streamline the development process and make it easy to manage dependencies, build projects, and ensure code quality.\\n\\n8. **Expressiveness**: Rust combines low-level control with high-level abstractions, allowing developers to write expressive and concise code. Its functional programming features, pattern matching, and type system make it a versatile language for a wide range of applications.\\n\\nOverall, Rust's combination of memory safety, performance, concurrency support, safety guarantees, community engagement, robust tooling, and expressiveness sets it apart from other programming languages and makes it a compelling choice for systems programming and beyond.\"),\n",

It achieves this through the concept of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, which prevent common programming errors such as null pointer dereferencing, data races, and memory leaks.\\n\\n2. **Concurrency**: Rust provides built-in support for concurrent programming through its ownership system. The ownership model ensures thread safety at compile time, allowing developers to write concurrent code that is free from data races.\\n\\n3. **Performance**: Rust is designed to offer high performance similar to low-level languages like C and C++. It achieves this by providing fine-grained control over memory layout and allocation, enabling efficient code generation.\\n\\n4. **Zero-cost Abstractions**: Rust allows developers to write high-level abstractions without incurring any runtime overhead. This is achieved through its ownership and borrowing system, which is enforced at compile time rather than runtime.\\n\\n5. **Safety**: Rust guarantees memory safety and thread safety through its strict compiler checks. The compiler enforces rules at compile time that prevent common bugs and vulnerabilities, making Rust code robust and secure.\\n\\n6. **Community**: Rust has a vibrant and welcoming community that actively contributes to the language's development. The Rust community is known for its focus on inclusivity, diversity, and providing a supportive environment for learning and collaboration.\\n\\n7. **Tooling**: Rust comes with a powerful toolchain, including Cargo (package manager), rustc (compiler), and rustup (toolchain manager). These tools streamline the development process and make it easy to manage dependencies, build projects, and ensure code quality.\\n\\n8. **Expressiveness**: Rust combines low-level control with high-level abstractions, allowing developers to write expressive and concise code. Its functional programming features, pattern matching, and type system make it a versatile language for a wide range of applications.\\n\\nOverall, Rust's combination of memory safety, performance, concurrency support, safety guarantees, community engagement, robust tooling, and expressiveness sets it apart from other programming languages and makes it a compelling choice for systems programming and beyond.\"),\n",

              "  HumanMessage(content='From that book of Kotlin for android developers, can explain to me the concept of delegation and imprimatation of lazy data? provide an example'),\n",
              "  AIMessage(content='### Delegation in Kotlin:\\nDelegation in Kotlin allows one class to provide implementations for certain methods by delegating them to another object. It helps in reusing code and separating concerns by delegating specific functionality to another class. \\n\\n#### Example of Delegation:\\n```kotlin\\ninterface Sound {\\n    fun makeSound()\\n}\\n\\nclass Dog : Sound {\\n    override fun makeSound() {\\n        println(\"Woof Woof!\")\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Cat : Sound {\\n    override fun makeSound() {\\n        println(\"Meow Meow!\")\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Animal(sound: Sound) : Sound by sound\\n\\nfun main() {\\n    val dog = Dog()\\n    val animal = Animal(dog)\\n    \\n    animal.makeSound() // Delegates makeSound() to Dog class\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `Animal` class delegates the `makeSound()` method to the object provided during initialization. When `makeSound()` is called on an `Animal` object, it is actually delegated to the `Dog` or `Cat` object that was passed during creation.\\n\\n### Lazy Initialization in Kotlin:\\nLazy initialization is a design pattern where an object is only created when it is first accessed, rather than when it is instantiated. In Kotlin, lazy initialization is achieved using the `lazy` function, which creates a delegate that initializes the value the first time it is accessed.\\n\\n#### Example of Lazy Initialization:\\n```kotlin\\nclass HeavyObject {\\n    init {\\n        println(\"Creating Heavy Object\")\\n    }\\n    \\n    fun performAction() {\\n        println(\"Action performed on Heavy Object\")\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass LazyData {\\n    val heavyObject: HeavyObject by lazy {\\n        HeavyObject()\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nfun main() {\\n    val lazyData = LazyData()\\n    println(\"LazyData created\")\\n    \\n    // HeavyObject is not created yet\\n    \\n    lazyData.heavyObject.performAction() // HeavyObject is created here\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `HeavyObject` is only created when `performAction()` is called on the `LazyData` object. The `lazy` delegate ensures that the `HeavyObject` is initialized lazily, i.e., when it is first accessed.\\n\\nBoth delegation and lazy initialization are powerful concepts in Kotlin that help in writing clean, reusable, and efficient code by delegating responsibilities and delaying object creation until necessary.'),\n",

              "  AIMessage(content=\"Rust is considered special and unique among programming languages due to the following key features and characteristics:\\n\\n1. **Memory Safety**: Rust's most distinctive feature is its emphasis on memory safety without the need for a garbage collector. It achieves this through the concept of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, which prevent common programming errors such as null pointer dereferencing, data races, and memory leaks.\\n\\n2. **Concurrency**: Rust provides built-in support for concurrent programming through its ownership system. The ownership model ensures thread safety at compile time, allowing developers to write concurrent code that is free from data races.\\n\\n3. **Performance**: Rust is designed to offer high performance similar to low-level languages like C and C++. It achieves this by providing fine-grained control over memory layout and allocation, enabling efficient code generation.\\n\\n4. **Zero-cost Abstractions**: Rust allows developers to write high-level abstractions without incurring any runtime overhead. This is achieved through its ownership and borrowing system, which is enforced at compile time rather than runtime.\\n\\n5. **Safety**: Rust guarantees memory safety and thread safety through its strict compiler checks. The compiler enforces rules at compile time that prevent common bugs and vulnerabilities, making Rust code robust and secure.\\n\\n6. **Community**: Rust has a vibrant and welcoming community that actively contributes to the language's development. The Rust community is known for its focus on inclusivity, diversity, and providing a supportive environment for learning and collaboration.\\n\\n7. **Tooling**: Rust comes with a powerful toolchain, including Cargo (package manager), rustc (compiler), and rustup (toolchain manager). These tools streamline the development process and make it easy to manage dependencies, build projects, and ensure code quality.\\n\\n8. **Expressiveness**: Rust combines low-level control with high-level abstractions, allowing developers to write expressive and concise code. Its functional programming features, pattern matching, and type system make it a versatile language for a wide range of applications.\\n\\nOverall, Rust's combination of memory safety, performance, concurrency support, safety guarantees, community engagement, robust tooling, and expressiveness sets it apart from other programming languages and makes it a compelling choice for systems programming and beyond.\"),\n",

              "  HumanMessage(content='From that book of Kotlin for android developers, can explain to me the concept of delegation and imprimatation of lazy data? provide an example'),\n",
              "  AIMessage(content='### Delegation in Kotlin:\\nDelegation in Kotlin allows one class to provide implementations for certain methods by delegating them to another object. It helps in reusing code and separating concerns by delegating specific functionality to another class. \\n\\n#### Example of Delegation:\\n```kotlin\\ninterface Sound {\\n    fun makeSound()\\n}\\n\\nclass Dog : Sound {\\n    override fun makeSound() {\\n        println(\"Woof Woof!\")\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Cat : Sound {\\n    override fun makeSound() {\\n        println(\"Meow Meow!\")\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Animal(sound: Sound) : Sound by sound\\n\\nfun main() {\\n    val dog = Dog()\\n    val animal = Animal(dog)\\n    \\n    animal.makeSound() // Delegates makeSound() to Dog class\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `Animal` class delegates the `makeSound()` method to the object provided during initialization. When `makeSound()` is called on an `Animal` object, it is actually delegated to the `Dog` or `Cat` object that was passed during creation.\\n\\n### Lazy Initialization in Kotlin:\\nLazy initialization is a design pattern where an object is only created when it is first accessed, rather than when it is instantiated. In Kotlin, lazy initialization is achieved using the `lazy` function, which creates a delegate that initializes the value the first time it is accessed.\\n\\n#### Example of Lazy Initialization:\\n```kotlin\\nclass HeavyObject {\\n    init {\\n        println(\"Creating Heavy Object\")\\n    }\\n    \\n    fun performAction() {\\n        println(\"Action performed on Heavy Object\")\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass LazyData {\\n    val heavyObject: HeavyObject by lazy {\\n        HeavyObject()\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nfun main() {\\n    val lazyData = LazyData()\\n    println(\"LazyData created\")\\n    \\n    // HeavyObject is not created yet\\n    \\n    lazyData.heavyObject.performAction() // HeavyObject is created here\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `HeavyObject` is only created when `performAction()` is called on the `LazyData` object. The `lazy` delegate ensures that the `HeavyObject` is initialized lazily, i.e., when it is first accessed.\\n\\nBoth delegation and lazy initialization are powerful concepts in Kotlin that help in writing clean, reusable, and efficient code by delegating responsibilities and delaying object creation until necessary.'),\n",

It achieves this through the concept of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, which prevent common programming errors such as null pointer dereferencing, data races, and memory leaks.\\n\\n2. **Concurrency**: Rust provides built-in support for concurrent programming through its ownership system. The ownership model ensures thread safety at compile time, allowing developers to write concurrent code that is free from data races.\\n\\n3. **Performance**: Rust is designed to offer high performance similar to low-level languages like C and C++. It achieves this by providing fine-grained control over memory layout and allocation, enabling efficient code generation.\\n\\n4. **Zero-cost Abstractions**: Rust allows developers to write high-level abstractions without incurring any runtime overhead. This is achieved through its ownership and borrowing system, which is enforced at compile time rather than runtime.\\n\\n5. **Safety**: Rust guarantees memory safety and thread safety through its strict compiler checks. The compiler enforces rules at compile time that prevent common bugs and vulnerabilities, making Rust code robust and secure.\\n\\n6. **Community**: Rust has a vibrant and welcoming community that actively contributes to the language's development. The Rust community is known for its focus on inclusivity, diversity, and providing a supportive environment for learning and collaboration.\\n\\n7. **Tooling**: Rust comes with a powerful toolchain, including Cargo (package manager), rustc (compiler), and rustup (toolchain manager). These tools streamline the development process and make it easy to manage dependencies, build projects, and ensure code quality.\\n\\n8. **Expressiveness**: Rust combines low-level control with high-level abstractions, allowing developers to write expressive and concise code. Its functional programming features, pattern matching, and type system make it a versatile language for a wide range of applications.\\n\\nOverall, Rust's combination of memory safety, performance, concurrency support, safety guarantees, community engagement, robust tooling, and expressiveness sets it apart from other programming languages and makes it a compelling choice for systems programming and beyond.\"),\n",

              "  HumanMessage(content='From that book of Kotlin for android developers, can explain to me the concept of delegation and imprimatation of lazy data? provide an example'),\n",
              "  AIMessage(content='### Delegation in Kotlin:\\nDelegation in Kotlin allows one class to provide implementations for certain methods by delegating them to another object. It helps in reusing code and separating concerns by delegating specific functionality to another class. \\n\\n#### Example of Delegation:\\n```kotlin\\ninterface Sound {\\n    fun makeSound()\\n}\\n\\nclass Dog : Sound {\\n    override fun makeSound() {\\n        println(\"Woof Woof!\")\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Cat : Sound {\\n    override fun makeSound() {\\n        println(\"Meow Meow!\")\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Animal(sound: Sound) : Sound by sound\\n\\nfun main() {\\n    val dog = Dog()\\n    val animal = Animal(dog)\\n    \\n    animal.makeSound() // Delegates makeSound() to Dog class\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `Animal` class delegates the `makeSound()` method to the object provided during initialization. When `makeSound()` is called on an `Animal` object, it is actually delegated to the `Dog` or `Cat` object that was passed during creation.\\n\\n### Lazy Initialization in Kotlin:\\nLazy initialization is a design pattern where an object is only created when it is first accessed, rather than when it is instantiated. In Kotlin, lazy initialization is achieved using the `lazy` function, which creates a delegate that initializes the value the first time it is accessed.\\n\\n#### Example of Lazy Initialization:\\n```kotlin\\nclass HeavyObject {\\n    init {\\n        println(\"Creating Heavy Object\")\\n    }\\n    \\n    fun performAction() {\\n        println(\"Action performed on Heavy Object\")\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass LazyData {\\n    val heavyObject: HeavyObject by lazy {\\n        HeavyObject()\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nfun main() {\\n    val lazyData = LazyData()\\n    println(\"LazyData created\")\\n    \\n    // HeavyObject is not created yet\\n    \\n    lazyData.heavyObject.performAction() // HeavyObject is created here\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `HeavyObject` is only created when `performAction()` is called on the `LazyData` object. The `lazy` delegate ensures that the `HeavyObject` is initialized lazily, i.e., when it is first accessed.\\n\\nBoth delegation and lazy initialization are powerful concepts in Kotlin that help in writing clean, reusable, and efficient code by delegating responsibilities and delaying object creation until necessary.'),\n",

It achieves this through the concept of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, which prevent common programming errors such as null pointer dereferencing, data races, and memory leaks.\\n\\n2. **Concurrency**: Rust provides built-in support for concurrent programming through its ownership system. The ownership model ensures thread safety at compile time, allowing developers to write concurrent code that is free from data races.\\n\\n3. **Performance**: Rust is designed to offer high performance similar to low-level languages like C and C++. It achieves this by providing fine-grained control over memory layout and allocation, enabling efficient code generation.\\n\\n4. **Zero-cost Abstractions**: Rust allows developers to write high-level abstractions without incurring any runtime overhead. This is achieved through its ownership and borrowing system, which is enforced at compile time rather than runtime.\\n\\n5. **Safety**: Rust guarantees memory safety and thread safety through its strict compiler checks. The compiler enforces rules at compile time that prevent common bugs and vulnerabilities, making Rust code robust and secure.\\n\\n6. **Community**: Rust has a vibrant and welcoming community that actively contributes to the language's development. The Rust community is known for its focus on inclusivity, diversity, and providing a supportive environment for learning and collaboration.\\n\\n7. **Tooling**: Rust comes with a powerful toolchain, including Cargo (package manager), rustc (compiler), and rustup (toolchain manager). These tools streamline the development process and make it easy to manage dependencies, build projects, and ensure code quality.\\n\\n8. **Expressiveness**: Rust combines low-level control with high-level abstractions, allowing developers to write expressive and concise code. Its functional programming features, pattern matching, and type system make it a versatile language for a wide range of applications.\\n\\nOverall, Rust's combination of memory safety, performance, concurrency support, safety guarantees, community engagement, robust tooling, and expressiveness sets it apart from other programming languages and makes it a compelling choice for systems programming and beyond.\"),\n",

              "  HumanMessage(content='From that book of Kotlin for android developers, can explain to me the concept of delegation and imprimatation of lazy data? provide an example'),\n",
              "  AIMessage(content='### Delegation in Kotlin:\\nDelegation in Kotlin allows one class to provide implementations for certain methods by delegating them to another object. It helps in reusing code and separating concerns by delegating specific functionality to another class. \\n\\n#### Example of Delegation:\\n```kotlin\\ninterface Sound {\\n    fun makeSound()\\n}\\n\\nclass Dog : Sound {\\n    override fun makeSound() {\\n        println(\"Woof Woof!\")\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Cat : Sound {\\n    override fun makeSound() {\\n        println(\"Meow Meow!\")\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Animal(sound: Sound) : Sound by sound\\n\\nfun main() {\\n    val dog = Dog()\\n    val animal = Animal(dog)\\n    \\n    animal.makeSound() // Delegates makeSound() to Dog class\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `Animal` class delegates the `makeSound()` method to the object provided during initialization. When `makeSound()` is called on an `Animal` object, it is actually delegated to the `Dog` or `Cat` object that was passed during creation.\\n\\n### Lazy Initialization in Kotlin:\\nLazy initialization is a design pattern where an object is only created when it is first accessed, rather than when it is instantiated. In Kotlin, lazy initialization is achieved using the `lazy` function, which creates a delegate that initializes the value the first time it is accessed.\\n\\n#### Example of Lazy Initialization:\\n```kotlin\\nclass HeavyObject {\\n    init {\\n        println(\"Creating Heavy Object\")\\n    }\\n    \\n    fun performAction() {\\n        println(\"Action performed on Heavy Object\")\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass LazyData {\\n    val heavyObject: HeavyObject by lazy {\\n        HeavyObject()\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nfun main() {\\n    val lazyData = LazyData()\\n    println(\"LazyData created\")\\n    \\n    // HeavyObject is not created yet\\n    \\n    lazyData.heavyObject.performAction() // HeavyObject is created here\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `HeavyObject` is only created when `performAction()` is called on the `LazyData` object. The `lazy` delegate ensures that the `HeavyObject` is initialized lazily, i.e., when it is first accessed.\\n\\nBoth delegation and lazy initialization are powerful concepts in Kotlin that help in writing clean, reusable, and efficient code by delegating responsibilities and delaying object creation until necessary.'),\n",

It achieves this through the concept of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, which prevent common programming errors such as null pointer dereferencing, data races, and memory leaks.\\n\\n2. **Concurrency**: Rust provides built-in support for concurrent programming through its ownership system. The ownership model ensures thread safety at compile time, allowing developers to write concurrent code that is free from data races.\\n\\n3. **Performance**: Rust is designed to offer high performance similar to low-level languages like C and C++. It achieves this by providing fine-grained control over memory layout and allocation, enabling efficient code generation.\\n\\n4. **Zero-cost Abstractions**: Rust allows developers to write high-level abstractions without incurring any runtime overhead. This is achieved through its ownership and borrowing system, which is enforced at compile time rather than runtime.\\n\\n5. **Safety**: Rust guarantees memory safety and thread safety through its strict compiler checks. The compiler enforces rules at compile time that prevent common bugs and vulnerabilities, making Rust code robust and secure.\\n\\n6. **Community**: Rust has a vibrant and welcoming community that actively contributes to the language's development. The Rust community is known for its focus on inclusivity, diversity, and providing a supportive environment for learning and collaboration.\\n\\n7. **Tooling**: Rust comes with a powerful toolchain, including Cargo (package manager), rustc (compiler), and rustup (toolchain manager). These tools streamline the development process and make it easy to manage dependencies, build projects, and ensure code quality.\\n\\n8. **Expressiveness**: Rust combines low-level control with high-level abstractions, allowing developers to write expressive and concise code. Its functional programming features, pattern matching, and type system make it a versatile language for a wide range of applications.\\n\\nOverall, Rust's combination of memory safety, performance, concurrency support, safety guarantees, community engagement, robust tooling, and expressiveness sets it apart from other programming languages and makes it a compelling choice for systems programming and beyond.\"),\n",

              "  HumanMessage(content='From that book of Kotlin for android developers, can explain to me the concept of delegation and imprimatation of lazy data? provide an example'),\n",
              "  AIMessage(content='### Delegation in Kotlin:\\nDelegation in Kotlin allows one class to provide implementations for certain methods by delegating them to another object. It helps in reusing code and separating concerns by delegating specific functionality to another class. \\n\\n#### Example of Delegation:\\n```kotlin\\ninterface Sound {\\n    fun makeSound()\\n}\\n\\nclass Dog : Sound {\\n    override fun makeSound() {\\n        println(\"Woof Woof!\")\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Cat : Sound {\\n    override fun makeSound() {\\n        println(\"Meow Meow!\")\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Animal(sound: Sound) : Sound by sound\\n\\nfun main() {\\n    val dog = Dog()\\n    val animal = Animal(dog)\\n    \\n    animal.makeSound() // Delegates makeSound() to Dog class\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `Animal` class delegates the `makeSound()` method to the object provided during initialization. When `makeSound()` is called on an `Animal` object, it is actually delegated to the `Dog` or `Cat` object that was passed during creation.\\n\\n### Lazy Initialization in Kotlin:\\nLazy initialization is a design pattern where an object is only created when it is first accessed, rather than when it is instantiated. In Kotlin, lazy initialization is achieved using the `lazy` function, which creates a delegate that initializes the value the first time it is accessed.\\n\\n#### Example of Lazy Initialization:\\n```kotlin\\nclass HeavyObject {\\n    init {\\n        println(\"Creating Heavy Object\")\\n    }\\n    \\n    fun performAction() {\\n        println(\"Action performed on Heavy Object\")\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass LazyData {\\n    val heavyObject: HeavyObject by lazy {\\n        HeavyObject()\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nfun main() {\\n    val lazyData = LazyData()\\n    println(\"LazyData created\")\\n    \\n    // HeavyObject is not created yet\\n    \\n    lazyData.heavyObject.performAction() // HeavyObject is created here\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `HeavyObject` is only created when `performAction()` is called on the `LazyData` object. The `lazy` delegate ensures that the `HeavyObject` is initialized lazily, i.e., when it is first accessed.\\n\\nBoth delegation and lazy initialization are powerful concepts in Kotlin that help in writing clean, reusable, and efficient code by delegating responsibilities and delaying object creation until necessary.'),\n",

However, if you are looking to draw parallels between JavaScript and Rust, here are some key differences and similarities:\\n\\n### Differences between JavaScript and Rust:\\n1. **Static vs. Dynamic Typing**: Rust is statically typed, meaning types are checked at compile time, while JavaScript is dynamically typed, allowing for more flexibility but potentially leading to runtime errors.\\n   \\n2. **Memory Management**: Rust's ownership system provides memory safety guarantees at compile time, while JavaScript relies on garbage collection for memory management.\\n  \\n3. **Concurrency**: Rust's ownership model allows for safe concurrency without data races, while JavaScript handles concurrency using asynchronous programming with callbacks, promises, or async/await.\\n\\n### Similarities between JavaScript and Rust:\\n1. **High-level Abstractions**: Both languages offer high-level abstractions and modern features to improve developer productivity.\\n   \\n2. **Functional Programming**: Both languages support functional programming paradigms, allowing for the creation of more functional and expressive code.\\n\\n3. **Community and Ecosystem**: Both languages have active communities and rich ecosystems with libraries and frameworks to support various development needs.\\n\\nWhile the Rust book does not specifically cover JavaScript content, understanding concepts from both languages can help broaden your programming knowledge and problem-solving skills. If you have specific questions or need further clarification on any Rust or JavaScript concepts, feel free to ask!\"),\n",

              "  AIMessage(content='Yes, you can create UI applications using Rust programming language. One popular framework for building GUI applications in Rust is `gtk-rs`, which provides bindings to the GTK toolkit. GTK is a widely used toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces and is cross-platform, allowing you to build UI applications that run on multiple operating systems.\\n\\nHere is an example of a simple UI application using Rust and `gtk-rs`:\\n\\n### Example of a UI Application using Rust and GTK:\\n\\n```rust\\nextern crate gtk;\\nuse gtk::prelude::*;\\nuse gtk::{Application, ApplicationWindow, Button};\\n\\nfn main() {\\n    // Initialize GTK application\\n    let app = Application::builder()\\n        .application_id(\"com.example.myapp\")\\n        .build();\\n\\n    // Connect to the \"activate\" signal to create the window\\n    app.connect_activate(|app| {\\n        let window = ApplicationWindow::builder()\\n            .application(app)\\n            .title(\"Rust GTK Example\")\\n            .default_width(320)\\n            .default_height(240)\\n            .build();\\n\\n        let button = Button::with_label(\"Click Me!\");\\n        button.connect_clicked(|_| {\\n            println!(\"Button clicked!\");\\n        });\\n\\n        window.set_child(Some(&button));\\n        window.show();\\n    });\\n\\n    // Run the application\\n    app.run();\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Steps to Run the Rust GTK Application:\\n1. Add the necessary dependencies in your `Cargo.toml` file:\\n   ```toml\\n   [dependencies]\\n   gtk = \"0.9.1\"\\n   ```\\n2. Create a new Rust file and add the above code.\\n3. Run the application using `cargo run`.\\n\\nThis example creates a simple GTK window with a button that prints a message when clicked. You can expand on this example to build more complex UI applications using Rust and GTK. The `gtk-rs` crate provides a rich set of widgets and features for creating interactive and visually appealing GUI applications in Rust.'),\n",

It achieves this through the concept of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, which prevent common programming errors such as null pointer dereferencing, data races, and memory leaks.\\n\\n2. **Concurrency**: Rust provides built-in support for concurrent programming through its ownership system. The ownership model ensures thread safety at compile time, allowing developers to write concurrent code that is free from data races.\\n\\n3. **Performance**: Rust is designed to offer high performance similar to low-level languages like C and C++. It achieves this by providing fine-grained control over memory layout and allocation, enabling efficient code generation.\\n\\n4. **Zero-cost Abstractions**: Rust allows developers to write high-level abstractions without incurring any runtime overhead. This is achieved through its ownership and borrowing system, which is enforced at compile time rather than runtime.\\n\\n5. **Safety**: Rust guarantees memory safety and thread safety through its strict compiler checks. The compiler enforces rules at compile time that prevent common bugs and vulnerabilities, making Rust code robust and secure.\\n\\n6. **Community**: Rust has a vibrant and welcoming community that actively contributes to the language's development. The Rust community is known for its focus on inclusivity, diversity, and providing a supportive environment for learning and collaboration.\\n\\n7. **Tooling**: Rust comes with a powerful toolchain, including Cargo (package manager), rustc (compiler), and rustup (toolchain manager). These tools streamline the development process and make it easy to manage dependencies, build projects, and ensure code quality.\\n\\n8. **Expressiveness**: Rust combines low-level control with high-level abstractions, allowing developers to write expressive and concise code. Its functional programming features, pattern matching, and type system make it a versatile language for a wide range of applications.\\n\\nOverall, Rust's combination of memory safety, performance, concurrency support, safety guarantees, community engagement, robust tooling, and expressiveness sets it apart from other programming languages and makes it a compelling choice for systems programming and beyond.\"),\n",

Example Code:\\n#### Rust API Backend (Example using Actix-web):\\n```rust\\nuse actix_web::{web, App, HttpServer, Responder, HttpResponse};\\n\\nasync fn hello() -> impl Responder {\\n    HttpResponse::Ok().body(\"Hello from Rust API!\")\\n}\\n\\n#[actix_web::main]\\nasync fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\\n    HttpServer::new(|| {\\n        App::new()\\n            .route(\"/hello\", web::get().to(hello))\\n    })\\n    .bind(\"127.0.0.1:8080\")?\\n    .run()\\n    .await\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Android App (Example using Kotlin and Retrofit):\\n```kotlin\\ninterface ApiService {\\n    @GET(\"/hello\")\\n    fun getHello(): Call<String>\\n}\\n\\nval retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()\\n    .baseUrl(\"http://10.0.2.2:8080\") // Use 10.0.2.2 for localhost on emulator\\n    .addConverterFactory(ScalarsConverterFactory.create())\\n    .build()\\n\\nval apiService = retrofit.create(ApiService::class.java)\\n\\nval call = apiService.getHello()\\ncall.enqueue(object : Callback<String> {\\n    override fun onResponse(call: Call<String>, response: Response<String>) {\\n        if (response.isSuccessful) {\\n            val message = response.body()\\n            // Handle the response\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    override fun onFailure(call: Call<String>, t: Throwable) {\\n        // Handle errors\\n    }\\n})\\n```\\n\\n### 4. Running the Example:\\n1. Start the Rust API server.\\n2. Run the Android app on an emulator or physical device.\\n3. The app should make a request to the Rust API and receive the \"Hello from Rust API!\" response.\\n\\nThis example demonstrates how to create a simple Android app that connects to a Rust API backend using HTTP requests. Remember to replace the IP address and port with the appropriate values for your setup.'),\n",
              "  HumanMessage(content='From that book of Kotlin for android developers, can explain to me the concept of delegation and imprimatation of lazy data? provide an example'),\n",
              "  AIMessage(content='### Delegation in Kotlin:\\nDelegation in Kotlin allows one class to provide implementations for certain methods by delegating them to another object. It helps in reusing code and separating concerns by delegating specific functionality to another class. \\n\\n#### Example of Delegation:\\n```kotlin\\ninterface Sound {\\n    fun makeSound()\\n}\\n\\nclass Dog : Sound {\\n    override fun makeSound() {\\n        println(\"Woof Woof!\")\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Cat : Sound {\\n    override fun makeSound() {\\n        println(\"Meow Meow!\")\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Animal(sound: Sound) : Sound by sound\\n\\nfun main() {\\n    val dog = Dog()\\n    val animal = Animal(dog)\\n    \\n    animal.makeSound() // Delegates makeSound() to Dog class\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `Animal` class delegates the `makeSound()` method to the object provided during initialization. When `makeSound()` is called on an `Animal` object, it is actually delegated to the `Dog` or `Cat` object that was passed during creation.\\n\\n### Lazy Initialization in Kotlin:\\nLazy initialization is a design pattern where an object is only created when it is first accessed, rather than when it is instantiated. In Kotlin, lazy initialization is achieved using the `lazy` function, which creates a delegate that initializes the value the first time it is accessed.\\n\\n#### Example of Lazy Initialization:\\n```kotlin\\nclass HeavyObject {\\n    init {\\n        println(\"Creating Heavy Object\")\\n    }\\n    \\n    fun performAction() {\\n        println(\"Action performed on Heavy Object\")\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass LazyData {\\n    val heavyObject: HeavyObject by lazy {\\n        HeavyObject()\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nfun main() {\\n    val lazyData = LazyData()\\n    println(\"LazyData created\")\\n    \\n    // HeavyObject is not created yet\\n    \\n    lazyData.heavyObject.performAction() // HeavyObject is created here\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `HeavyObject` is only created when `performAction()` is called on the `LazyData` object. The `lazy` delegate ensures that the `HeavyObject` is initialized lazily, i.e., when it is first accessed.\\n\\nBoth delegation and lazy initialization are powerful concepts in Kotlin that help in writing clean, reusable, and efficient code by delegating responsibilities and delaying object creation until necessary.'),\n",
